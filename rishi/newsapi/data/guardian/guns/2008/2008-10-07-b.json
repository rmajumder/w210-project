  "<p><strong>\"Paul Doyle suggested in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/24/carlingcup.newcastleunited\">recent minute-by-minute report</a> that a potential Newcastle-Tottenham shoot-out could be the worst ever and end nil-nil. It got me thinking, what is the worst penalty shoot-out there has ever been?\"</strong> asked Mike Gibbons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/30/westhamunited.realmadrid\">last week</a>.</p> <p>As Bill Martin, Florian Kinast and Paul Fields all point out, the shoot-out in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY_WxaVnjGg\">1986 European Cup final</a> takes some beating. Barcelona and Steaua Bucharest had played out 120 of the most tedious minutes of football ever witnessed in a major final, and with the scores at 0-0 the game went to penalties, at which point both teams missed their first two. The Romanians then found their shooting boots and knocked home their next two, but Bar\u00e7a, then managed by Terry Venables, twice more failed to beat Helmuth Duckadam in the Steaua goal. Duckadam, who became known as 'the hero of Seville', had saved all four spot-kicks from Jos\u00e9 Alexanko, \u00c1ngel Pedraza, Pichi Alonso and Marcos Alonso, enabling Steaua to run out 2-0 winners.</p> <p>Sadly Duckadam, who at 27 was reaching his peak years as a goalkeeper, was forced to retire shortly after his finest hour. \"Just a few weeks after his epic moment,\" writes Florian, \"Duckadam's career came to an end due to a rare vascular disease in his right arm.\"</p> <p>Florian also points to Thailand's 1-0 win on penalties over Bangladesh in the 1973 Merdeka Tournament, in which Singapore also beat Cambodia 1-0 in a shoot-out.<br> The world record for the worst-ever penalty shoot-out, however, is quite predictably held by a pair of English sides. In January 1998 Under-10 sides Mickleover Lightning Blue Sox and Chellaston Boys faced off in the Derby Community Cup. The game finished 1-1 and the Blue Sox won 2-1 on penalties, though not until a remarkable 66 penalties had been taken. Thanks to Paul Haynes for that one.</p> <p>All these and many other penalty-related facts, including the best-ever shootouts, can be found at the ever-marvellous <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/penalties.html\">rsssf.com</a></p> <p><strong>THE BIGGIST PLUG OUTSIDE THE BFG'S BATH</strong></p> <p>Coming soon, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbooks.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10401_25501_132806_100_38603_38603_category_\">The Knowledge</a> in book form, a collection of our favourite questions and answers from the past eight years.</p> <p><strong>THE 30-YEAR CREDIT CRUNCH</strong></p> <p><strong>\"I read last year that Glenn Murray was the most expensive player Brighton had signed since Terry Connor joined in 1983 (as part of a swap deal with Andy Ritchie) - does any club have a longer-standing record signing?\"</strong> asked Ben Peachey last week.</p> <p>Brighton's transfer record actually stretches back to October 1980 and the \u00a3500,000 signing of Ritchie from Manchester United, and there are few clubs in England that can surpass it.</p> <p>Few, indeed, come close. 1989 is a year from which several clubs' transfer records still stand. Luton (Lars Elstrup, \u00a3850,000 from Odense), Leyton Orient (Paul Beesley, \u00a3175,000 from Wigan), Bournemouth (Gavin Peacock, \u00a3210,000 from Gillingham) and Millwall (Paul Goddard, \u00a3800,000 from Derby County) will all be celebrating, if that is the right word, the 20th anniversary of their biggest splurge next year.</p> <p>Surpassing Brighton, if only by a few months, are Rotherham United. The \u00a3150,000 the Millers paid Millwall for the services of Tony Towner in August 1980 has never been exceeded by the club, though they have equalled it on three occasions since for the strikers Lee Glover, Alan Lee and Martin Butler.</p> <p>Rob Davies, Mickey Smith and Tom Lines also email with a mixture of pride and embarrassment to offer the name of Walsall's record signing Alan Buckley. \"Buckley was bought from Birmingham City in June 1979 for the then enormous transfer fee of \u00a3175,000,\" writes Rob. \"He went on to manage the club and holds a special place in the hearts of many Walsall fans.\"</p> <p>Walsall claim the record for Football League clubs, but it would appear that Wrexham hold the overall title. They forked out \u00a3210,000 for Liverpool's Joey Jones in October 1978, a figure unsurpassed since. And with the club currently languishing in the Blue Square Premier, there's little prospect of it being eclipsed any time soon.</p> <p><strong>TOTTENHAM OLD BOYS</strong></p> <p><strong>\"These are tough times for Spurs fans and they're not made easier when you see a load of ex-Spurs players plying their trade with aplomb at other Premiership clubs,\"</strong> moans Dan Dobson. <strong>\"To make things worse, these players always up their game when playing against Spurs. Am I right in thinking that there are more ex-Spurs players currently playing in the Premiership than from any other Premier League club?\"</strong></p> <p>Much as we hate giving Spurs fans another birch with which to beat themselves, Dan is indeed correct - an incredible 26 former Tottenham players have been on the pitch for other Premier League clubs so far this season, comfortably more than anyone other club <em>in the world</em>. Next up is West Ham, with 20 alumni playing elsewhere, and thirdly come Liverpool with 19.</p> <p>Outside the Premier League, Birmingham put up an impressive show with 17, Leeds have 15, Charlton 12 and, impressively, League Two Bradford have eight. Of clubs outside the UK, Ajax, Porto, Feyenoord and Lens are the best represented, matching Bradford's tally.</p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p>\"Down at the pub the other night, a friend of mine bullishly claimed he'd heard that a match was once postponed on almost 30 separate occasions. Is he having me on?\" asked Jonathan Gainter in 2006.</p> <p>Hail your friend, Jonathan, as he speaks the truth. Back in the icy winter of 1979, the Scottish Cup second-round clash between Inverness Thistle and Falkirk had to be postponed no fewer than 29 times. The original date for the game was January 6, but the clubs had to wait 47 days until the Kings Mills ground was eventually declared playable, on February 22. When the match finally took place, four first-half goals helped Falkirk seal their spot in the third round. However, because of the 71-day period between the second-round draw and Falkirk's win, Billy Little's side were forced to visit Dundee just three days later in round three, where a late penalty ended their cup journey.</p> <p>Incredible as these 29 postponements are, the tie is still eclipsed by another Scottish Cup game that took place 16 years earlier, when sub-zero conditions again played havoc with the fixture list - and not just in Scotland but all across Britain. More than 400 English league and cup matches fell victim to the weather and the season had to be extended by a month on both sides of the border. While one FA Cup third-round tie between Coventry and Lincoln eventually took place at the 16th time of asking, the clash between Airdrie and Stranraer was busy setting a British record of 33 postponements. For Airdrie it was 34th time lucky as they ran out 3-0 victors.</p> <p>Incidentally, the worst day of domestic cancellations didn't occur in 1962-63. That honour went to February 3 1940, when only one of 56 wartime league matches beat the weather. Plymouth made the most of their moment in the limelight with a 10-3 thumping of Bristol City.</p> <p>For many more sepia-tinged questions and answers, why not visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">the Knowledge archive</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can you help?</strong></p> <p>\"I've noticed that there are three Scottish managers in Group E of the Champions League this year \u2013 Sir Alex Ferguson, Bruce Rioch and Gordon Strachan,\" writes Grant Campbell. \"Have there ever been more managers from one country in a European group?\"</p> <p>\"I was curious to hear of Jorvan Vieira coaching Iraq to the 2007 Asia Cup without stepping into the country,\" writes Barry Derbyshire. \"Was this a unique feat?

  "<p>While governments around the world try to make sense of the internet and wonder how to curb some of its darker incarnations, all eyes should now be on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/korea\">South Korea</a>, which is one of the first democracies planning to use the law to hold the internet to account. </p> <p>Many believe that the government's attempt to impose rules on internet users will fail. What it is seeking to do is bring websites in line with traditional media: to make them accountable, subject to laws of libel and so forth.</p> <p>This is a risky strategy for Seoul: if it fails, the government will face the kind of online rebellion that nearly ended the ruling government's tenure only a few months ago.</p> <p>South Korea is possibly the most wired nation on Earth: 97% of South Korean households have high-speed broadband access. In the UK, by comparison, 35% of homes have no access to the web at all. </p> <p><strong>Bad manners</strong></p> <p>Some observers say this growth in internet access has brought out the worst in South Koreans.</p> <p>\"Internet behaviour in South Korea is somewhat of a low culture. I'm often disgusted or even offended by the manners on the net,\" says Dr Youngmi Kim, a professor of sociology and politics at the University of Edinburgh whose research is focusing on issues of governability in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. She is against any outright censorship, but would like to see some sort of campaign encouraging better web manners.</p> <p>The South Korean government is ahead of her. Along with laws controlling internet postings, which are due to be passed in November, Seoul also plans to introduce internet etiquette and ethics lessons in schools this year for children aged seven and older.</p> <p>The question is, can you police the internet? British MPs seem to think so. Members of the Commons select committee for culture, media and sport, which has made the case for centralising controls, say they want \"a tighter form of self-regulation, under which the industry would speedily establish a self-regulatory body\".</p> <p>South Korea is going much further. Not only will all sites that publish news be liable to the same restrictions as newspapers, TV and radio, they will be answerable to a government regulatory body - the Korean Communications Standards Commission.</p> <p>The rules extend beyond websites to individuals. All forum and chatroom users will be required to make verifiable real-name registrations, while internet companies will have to make their search algorithms public to improve \"transparency\". Most controversial of all, the commission will be given powers to suspend the publication of articles accused of being fraudulent or slanderous, for a minimum of 30 days. During this period the commission will then decide if an article that has been been temporarily deleted or flagged should be removed permanently.</p> <p>However, Seoul's previous experience with such censorship suggest that unless the government hires thousands more people to staff the commission, which is already behind in processing some 2,000 internet-related objections, just addressing the initial complaints will be unworkable, untenable and unenforceable.</p> <p>Professor Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard's Berkman Centre for Internet &amp; Society, says other aspects of the new laws are unworkable. \"There are genuine worries about misinformation that can be spread online, but a regime of requiring real-name registrations for all message boards and chatooms would represent a sweeping law-enforcement effort - and one that could not be readily accomplished without filtering out overseas sites that decline to implement the requirement.\"</p> <p>Jean K Min of OhmyNews International, South Korea's leading citizen-<br>journalist-based portal, says that the new controls smack of Big Brother. \"The approval rating of president Lee fell below 20% after the fiasco of US beef imports and poor handling of other sensitive diplomatic issues. Many here suspect the ruling party lawmakers and government officials are actually trying to save the deeply unpopular government by intimidating netizens from posting free online opinions with a variety of new legislation and legal threats.\"</p> <p><strong>'Excessive emotional behaviour'</strong></p> <p>Myung-bak Lee, South Korea's president, defends the proposed measures as checks against \"a society rampant with excessive emotional behaviour, disorderliness and rudeness\". In a recent speech, he said: \"We have to guard against 'infodemics,' a phenomenon in which inaccurate, false information is disseminated; prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic.\"</p> <p>That speech followed internet-orchestrated protests in August that spilled over into candlelit rallies and vigils in protest at Seoul's decision to restart beef imports from the US. Composed mostly of the young, the protests emptied schools and colleges and brought cities to a standstill; many ended in violence.</p> <p>The Seoul government blamed the disruption on rumours and lies spread by internet users. It went on to accuse internet service providers of failing to police the content they host and of providing a platform for hate, libellous claims and cyber-bullying.</p> <p>Providers have heeded the warnings. Korea's biggest portal, Naver, says it will drop all its news output while its rival, Daum, has offered an olive branch to old media. Daum says it will share revenue from its banner advertisements on news stories with newspapers, TV and other media outlets providing the articles.</p> <p>There is an irony in the fact that South Korea, with its focus on giving its citizens access to the high-speed internet, is now seeking to curb how its people use the internet. But will it stick?</p>",
  "<p>Voting is one of the most heavily protected rights in the US but also one of the most abused - from early restrictions which enfranchised only white, male property owners to the infamous and racist Jim Crow laws which lasted into the 1960s. Republicans say new rules in place for the 2008 elections should ensure the integrity of the process. But Democrats argue the restrictions are aimed at either preventing or discouraging blacks, Latinos, poor whites and others from voting.</p> <p><strong>Indiana</strong> introduced a law in 2005 requiring voters to have a government-issued driving licence that includes photo ID. Fair voting rights groups and Democrats claim this discriminates against poor people, many of whom do not have cars. The Indiana supreme court upheld the new law in April this year. </p> <p><strong>Ohio</strong> in 2006 passed a law requiring that a registered letter with election information be sent to every registered voter in the state. These could not be forwarded and each undeliverable letter would be open to a challenge by Republicans. Known as \"vote cageing\", the law was overturned last month.</p> <p>A <strong>Michigan</strong> Republican official was quoted in September this year as saying that people whose homes had been repossessed would not be allowed to vote. After a public outcry and a threatened injunction, the Republican party said this had never been party policy. </p> <p><strong>Florida</strong> continues to have problems, in spite of the 2000 scandal, with stringent rules introduced on voter ID. Republicans will be free to challenge even minor spelling discrepancies between a driving licence and a home address. In 2000 Bush won Florida, and the presidency, by 537 votes.</p> <p><strong>Louisiana</strong> requires similar stringent match-ups on voter information as in other states, including Florida. This is particularly the case over people who have moved. But it is difficult to establish whether these requirements are motivated by partisanship or to prevent voter abuse.</p>",
  "<h2>Brown may campaign in Glenrothes byelection</h2> <p>Gordon Brown plans to personally campaign to retain Labour's seat in Glenrothes, despite claiming earlier this year that prime ministers should avoid byelection contests. Jim Murphy, the new Scottish secretary, said the prime minister was \"determined\" to take part in the campaign next to his own constituency if he could spare time from dealing with the banking crisis. Brown's arrival in Glenrothes is likely to ignite the battle for the seat. His future as Labour leader rests in part on preventing the Scottish National party from inflicting a third byelection defeat on the government this year. <br><strong>Severin Carrell</strong></p> <h2>Hell's Angel's killers were waiting in layby, jury told</h2> <p>The killers of the Hell's Angel shot dead on the M40 last year parked in a layby while they chose their victim from passing bikers, Birmingham crown court heard yesterday. Gerry Tobin, 35, was killed as he rode back to London from the Bulldog Bash biker festival in Warwickshire on August 12. The jury was shown CCTV images of a Rover car alleged to have been used in the shooting. Timothy Raggatt QC, prosecuting, said: \"The car closed up on Mr Tobin and there were two shots.\" One hit Tobin in the neck and passed through his spine into his skull. Six men deny murder and possessing firearms. The trial continues. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Return of jellyfish that caused \u00a31m salmon losses</h2> <p>Jellyfish which cost \u00a31m in losses to salmon farms in Northern Ireland have returned to the Irish Sea. The mauve stinger jellyfish were spotted along a beach at Portrush, according to the Environment Agency. Scientists have confirmed that the small purple creatures were the same type of jellyfish that killed more than 150,000 salmon in cages off the north Antrim coast last year. The agency said there was no indication yet of a repeat of last year's \"catastrophic bloom\". Marine conservation officer Joe Breen advised people to stay clear of the jellyfish, which could give \"a nasty, powerful sting\". <br><strong>Henry McDonald</strong></p> <h2>Diabetes costs NHS \u00a31m every hour, says charity</h2> <p>The NHS spends \u00a31m every hour on treating the medical consequences of diabetes, including blindness, stroke and amputation, researchers say today. The charity Diabetes UK found that the disease costs \u00a39bn a year, about 10% of the NHS budget. Douglas Smallwood, chief executive, said the number of people known to have diabetes increased from 1.3 million in 2002 to 2.3 million this year. About 500,000 cases were undiagnosed and a rise in obesity was likely to exacerbate the problem. By 2025 there would be more than 4 million diabetics, he said at the start of a healthier lifestyle campaign. <br><strong>John Carvel</strong></p> <h2>Animal rights conspiracy extended to US, court told</h2> <p>British extremists drew up plans to target every company that deals with the New York Stock Exchange as part of a six-year blackmail conspiracy to shut down one of the world's biggest animal testing laboratories, a court heard yesterday. Winchester crown court was told that leading members of the animal rights organisation Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac) considered how to put pressure on the New York Stock Exchange to stop listing shares in Huntingdon Life Sciences, in Cambridgeshire. The five defendants all deny conspiracy to blackmail. The trial continues. <br><strong>Sandra Laville</strong></p>",
  "<p>British forces are avoiding detaining suspected insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq because of fears they will be liable under the European human rights convention, a key Bush administration lawyer told the Guardian yesterday.</p> <p>John Bellinger, legal adviser to secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, said detention operations had been \"enormously complicated\" by the application of human rights protection to war zones outside Europe. </p> <p>\"Human rights law was arguably intended to apply to civilian populations,\" he said. \"There has been an effort to extend it to military operations that are becoming more like counter-insurgency operations.\"</p> <p>He also said the US wanted to try Binyam Mohamed, a British resident held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, for war crimes at a special military commission. The case is the subject of a legal struggle in the high court, which heard yesterday that the US authorities were refusing to hand over documents which could support Mohamed's claims that he has been tortured.</p> <p>Bellinger, in London for an international meeting of lawyers, said: \"Human rights law is clearly regionally intended to deal with the state's treatment of its own people. Importing concepts from human rights law is not necessarily the solution.\" </p> <p>The appeal court ruled in 2005 that British soldiers in Iraq are bound by the Human Rights Act where they have \"sufficient control\" over detainees. In a second landmark case last year, the government admitted \"substantive breaches\" of the European human rights convention over the death and torture of Iraqi civilians in the custody of British soldiers.</p> <p>The effect, Bellinger said yesterday, was palpable. \"European countries will go to great lengths to avoid detaining anyone in these places,\" he said.</p> <p>British defence officials expressed puzzlement at Bellinger's remarks. \"British forces are undergoing detention operations in Afghanistan; there is no suggestion that they have been scared off,\" said one. However, British commanders have asked for assurances any detainees handed over to the Afghan authorities will be treated properly, and not passed to the US. </p> <p>Richard Stein, a defence lawyer for Binyam Mohamed, said yesterday: \"In Europe, the courts take over and act while the Americans use might and power to operate outside the law.\" Bellinger told the Guardian that the US would strive to prevent Mohamed's return to Britain. \"Our defence department proposes to try Binyam Mohamed for war crimes.\"</p> <p>Mohamed, 30, denies any connection with terrorism, including claims he was involved in a \"dirty bomb\" plot, and says any confessions he may have made were extracted during torture. An Ethiopian national and British resident, he was held in Pakistan in 2002, when he was questioned by an MI5 officer. </p> <p>He was later secretly rendered to Morocco, where he says was tortured. The US subsequently flew him to Afghanistan and he was transferred to Guant\u00e1namo in September 2004.</p>",
  "<p>My first encounter with Tom Hurndall came on April 11 2003, via a BBC headline: \"Israeli troops wound Briton.\" Weeks earlier in Gaza, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) had killed peace activist Rachel Corrie, and before that, UN project manager Iain Hook. I tracked the story until the news agenda rolled on, and Tom Hurndall became yet another name on the list of casualties from what was then described as the most dangerous place on earth.</p> <p>I attended Tom's public memorial service a year later, having discovered the student photographer had been more than \"wounded\". During a Palestinian demonstration against IDF violence, three children had come under fire from an Israeli position. Tom ran forward to move the children to safety and was shot in the head. I was curious to know what had compelled this young Englishman to step into mortal danger. The eulogies inched me closer to understanding Tom, but raised a second question: what could possibly have been gained by shooting him?</p> <p>Months afterwards, I received a call from my agent about a film for Channel 4 regarding \"someone called Tom Hurndall. Have you heard of him?\" Wary, I went to the meeting and was hugely relieved that Charles Furneaux, the executive producer, wanted to make a worthy biopic of Tom even less than I wanted to write one. Charles's interest lay in an English family's quest for truth and justice in the democratic land of the Bible.</p> <p>Two weeks later I sat opposite Tom's parents, Jocelyn and Anthony. Jocelyn wept as she told of seeing Tom at the Israeli hospital, his swollen head packed into a helmet of bandages. I wanted to stop the interview, but it occurred to me that when someone is telling you about the very worst moment of their life, you just listen.</p> <p>I went to Israel to interview key people, including the sniper who had pulled the trigger, and Daniel Reisner, the IDF lawyer responsible for the legal sophistry allowing the \"principles of warfare\" to be applied to the second intifada. The Israeli lawyers were charming. I asked them why an IDF sniper might shoot someone like Tom, and each pointed to the \"lone rotten apple in a barrel\" hypothesis. Given that 634 Palestinian minors have been killed by the IDF in Gaza since 2000, according to B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, this argument would mean one soldier killed them all, or that the IDF barrel contains at least 634 \"rotten apples\". Another interpretation might suggest that the barrel has a disturbing effect on otherwise good apples.</p> <p>On our final morning in Israel, we visited the Jerusalem hostel where Tom stayed before travelling to Gaza. We were shown the bed he slept in, the table at which he ate. A poster of Tom was tacked to the wall beside posters of Rachel Corrie and Iain Hook: a \"martyrs' gallery\". But from what I had learned, Tom's outlook was far too curious, his scepticism too healthy for him to willingly sacrifice his life for a cause that wasn't his own.</p> <p>Within three months, I found myself in the office of then Channel 4 drama commissioner Francis Hopkinson. It was my birthday. He held the first draft of my script limply in his hands and told me, apologetically, that he liked about five scenes out of 120. Knowing I had never written a drama based on real events, he gave me a brilliant birthday gift: a script editor called Hilary Norrish. Hilary tore up the first quarter of my script, lit a cigarette, narrowed her eyes and growled: \"Forget the detail for now - what's this really about?\" Nine months and two drafts later, Channel 4 gave the green light for production. Six months of rewrites followed until director Rowan Joffe finally stood in the Jordanian desert and called: \"Action!\"</p> <p>I'm now at my desk, holding a photograph of Tom, taken and given to me by his girlfriend, Kay. Tom looks over his shoulder into the camera at Kay, at us all. I now know what made him step forward to save those children, and wonder if that's why an IDF sniper shot him for it - because, in the sniper's eyes, rescuing Palestinian children from Israeli gunfire was an act of unacceptable defiance.</p> <p>I reassure Tom that the film is not a worthy biopic no one would watch. From what I now know, that's the last thing he would want.</p> <p><strong>The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall </strong>is on Channel 4 on Monday at 9pm</p>",
  "<p>Japan's most powerful gangsters are mugging up on legal terminology to skirt strict new laws that make them liable for crimes committed by their henchmen.</p> <p>The top three syndicates are thought to have hired former prosecutors to teach them the finer points of the law, which was introduced after the yakuza killing of the Nagasaki mayor Iccho Ito in April.</p> <p>Reports said the legal change has unsettled senior members of the Yamaguchi-gumi, the biggest group, who could now be sued or jailed for crimes committed by underlings. Two other major gangs, the Inagawa-kai and Sumiyoshi-kai, have also called in experts, the Asahi Shimbun reported.</p> <p>The Yamaguchi-gumi has allegedly told its 40,000 members \"not to cause problems for members of the main clan\". The Asahi said police had obtained documents from the study meetings which were drafted by lawyers.</p> <p>The law claimed a success in August when a gangster was arrested for refusing to pay the bill at a hamburger joint in Kyoto. He paid after the owner threatened to charge his boss for the meal.</p> <p>Most top gangsters are also apparently afraid of being sued by victims of crimes committed by juniors. Legal experts are reportedly being paid big fees for talking yakuza leaders through the law and identifying loopholes, which include retroactive letters of expulsion to prove a suspect was no longer a gang member at the time he allegedly committed a crime.</p> <p>The legal revisions also aim to end the practice of rewarding yakuza members after they have served prison sentences. Money for jail time will probably now be paid in cash, not bank transfer.</p> <p>Public tolerance of underworld crimes has waned following murders involving non-yakuza victims. \"The cosy relationship between the police and the yakuza is coming to an end,\" a source close to the yakuza said. \"No one cared when they whacked each other, but when they started to kill civilians, people decided they'd had enough.\"</p>",
  "<p>The sun is setting and its dying rays cast triangles of light on to the bodies of the Indian workers. Two are washing themselves, scooping water from tubs in a small yard next to the labour camp's toilets. Others queue for their turn. One man stands stamping his feet in a bucket, turned into a human washing machine. The heat is suffocating and the sandy wind whips our faces. The sprinkles of water from men drying their clothes fall like welcome summer rain.</p> <p>All around, a city of labour camps stretches out in the middle of the Arabian desert, a jumble of low, concrete barracks, corrugated iron, chicken-mesh walls, barbed wire, scrap metal, empty paint cans, rusted machinery and thousands of men with tired and gloomy faces. </p> <p>I have left Dubai's spiralling towers, man-made islands and mega-malls behind and driven through the desert to the outskirts of the neighbouring city of Abu Dhabi. Turn right before the Zaha Hadid bridge, and a few hundred metres takes you to the heart of Mousafah, a ghetto-like neighbourhood of camps hidden away from the eyes of tourists. It is just one of many areas around the Gulf set aside for an army of labourers building the icons of architecture that are mushrooming all over the region. </p> <p>Behind the showers, in a yard paved with metal sheets, a line of men stands silently in front of grease-blackened pans, preparing their dinner. Sweat rolls down their heads and necks, their soaked shirts stuck to their backs. A heavy smell of spices and body odour fills the air. </p> <p>Next to a heap of rubbish, a man holds a plate containing his meal: a few chillies, an onion and three tomatoes, to be fried with spices and eaten with a piece of bread. </p> <p>In a neighbouring camp, a group of Pakistani workers from north and south Waziristan sit exhaustedly sipping tea while one of them cooks outside. In the middle of the cramped room in which 10 men sleep, one worker in a filthy robe sits on the floor grinding garlic and onions with a mortar and pestle while staring into the void. </p> <p>Hamidullah, a thin Afghan from Maydan, a village on the outskirts of Kabul, tells me: \"I spent five years in Iran and one year here, and one year here feels like 10 years. When I left Afghanistan I thought I would be back in a few months, but now I don't know when I will be back.\" Another worker on a bunk bed next to him adds: \"He called his home yesterday and they told him that three people from his village were killed in fighting. This is why we are here.\" </p> <p>Hamidullah earns around 450 dirhams (\u00a370) a month as a construction worker. </p> <p>How is life, I ask.</p> <p>\"What life? We have no life here. We are prisoners. We wake up at five, arrive to work at seven and are back at the camp at nine in the evening, day in and day out.\" </p> <p>Outside in the yard, another man sits on a chair made of salvaged wood, in front of a broken mirror, a plastic sheet wrapped around his neck, while the camp barber trims his thick beard. Despite the air of misery, tonight is a night of celebration. One of the men is back from a two-week break in his home village in Pakistan, bringing with him a big sack of rice, and is cooking pilau rice with meat. Rice is affordable at weekends only: already wretched incomes have been eroded by the weak dollar and rising food prices. \"Life is worse now,\" one worker told me. \"Before, we could get by on 140 dirhams [\u00a322] a month; now we need 320 to 350.\" </p> <p>The dozen or so men sit on newspapers advertising luxury watches, mobile phones and high-rise towers. When three plastic trays arrive, filled with yellowish rice and tiny cubes of meat, each offers the rare shreds of meat to his neighbours. </p> <p>All of these men are part of a huge scam that is helping the construction boom in the Gulf. Like hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, they each paid more than \u00a31,000 to employment agents in India and Pakistan. They were promised double the wages they are actually getting, plus plane tickets to visit their families once a year, but none of the men in the room had actually read their contract. Only two of them knew how to read. </p> <p>\"They lied to us,\" a worker with a long beard says. \"They told us lies to bring us here. Some of us sold their land; others took big loans to come and work here.\" </p> <p>Once they arrive in the United Arab Emirates, migrant workers are treated little better than cattle, with no access to healthcare and many other basic rights. The company that sponsors them holds on to their passports - and often a month or two of their wages to make sure that they keep working. And for this some will earn just 400 dirhams (\u00a362) a month.</p> <p>A group of construction engineers told me, with no apparent shame, that if a worker becomes too ill to work he will be sent home after a few days. \"They are the cheapest commodity here. Steel, concrete, everything is up, but workers are the same.\" </p> <p>As they eat, the men talk more about their lives. \"My shift is eight hours and two overtime, but in reality we work 18 hours,\" one says. \"The supervisors treat us like animals. I don't know if the owners [of the company] know.\" </p> <p>\"There is no war, and the police treat us well,\" another chips in, \"but the salary is not good.\"</p> <p>\"That man hasn't been home for four years,\" says Ahmad, the chef for the night, pointing at a well-built young man. \"He has no money to pay for the flight.\" </p> <p>A steel worker says he doesn't know who is supposed to pay for his ticket back home. At the recruiting agency they told him it would be the construction company - but he didn't get anything in writing.</p> <p>One experienced worker with spectacles and a prayer cap on his head tells me that things are much better than they used to be. Five years ago, when he first came, the company gave him nothing. There was no air conditioning in the room and sometimes no electricity. \"Now, they give AC to each room and a mattress for each worker.\" </p> <p>Immigrant workers have no right to form unions, but that didn't stop strikes and riots spreading across the region recently - something unheard of few years ago. Elsewhere in Mousafah, I encounter one of the very few illegal unions, where workers have established a form of underground insurance scheme, based on the tribal structure back home. \"When we come here,\" one member of the scheme tells me, \"we register with our tribal elders, and when one of us is injured and is sent home, or dies, the elders collect 30 dirhams from each of us and send the money home to his family.\"</p> <p>In a way, the men at Mousafah are the lucky ones. Down in the Diera quarter of old Dubai, where many of the city's illegal workers live, 20 men are often crammed into one small room. </p> <p>UN agencies estimate that there are up to 300,000 illegal workers in the emirates. </p> <p>On another hot evening, hundreds of men congregate in filthy alleyways at the end of a day's work, sipping tea and sitting on broken chairs. One man rests his back on the handles of his pushcart, silently eating his dinner next to a huge pile of garbage. </p> <p>In one of the houses, a man is hanging his laundry over the kitchen sink, a reeking smell coming from a nearby toilet. Next door, men lie on the floor. They tell me they are all illegal and they are scared and that I have to leave. </p> <p>Outside, a fistfight breaks out between Pakistani workers and Sri Lankans. </p> <p>The alleyways are dotted with sweatshops, where Indian men stay until late at night, bending over small tables sewing on beads. </p> <p>A couple of miles away, the slave market becomes more ugly. Outside a glitzy hotel, with a marble and glass facade, dozens of prostitutes congregate according to their ethnic groups: Asians to the right, next to them Africans, and, on the left, blondes from the former Soviet Union. There are some Arab women. Iranians, I am told, are in great demand. They charge much higher prices and are found only in luxury hotels. </p> <p>Like the rest of the Gulf region, Dubai and Abu Dhabi are being built by expat workers. They are strictly segregated, and a hierarchy worthy of previous centuries prevails. </p> <p>At the top, floating around in their black or white robes, are the locals with their oil money. Immaculate and pampered, they own everything. Outside the \"free zones\", where the rules are looser, no one can start a business in the UAE without a partner from the emirates, who often does nothing apart from lending his name. No one can get a work permit without a local sponsor. </p> <p>Under the locals come the western foreigners, the experts and advisers, making double the salaries they make back home, all tax free. Beneath them are the Arabs - Lebanese and Palestinians, Egyptians and Syrians. What unites these groups is a mixture of pretension and racism. </p> <p>\"Unrealistic things happen to your mind when you come here,\" a Lebanese woman who frequently visits Dubai tells me as she drives her new black SUV. \"Suddenly, you can make $5,000 [\u00a32,800] a month. You can get credit so easy, you buy the car of your dreams, you shop and you think it's a great bargain; when you go to dinner, you go to a hotel ... nowhere else can you live like this.\"</p> <p>Down at the base of the pyramid are the labourers, waiters, hotel employees and unskilled workers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, the Philippines and beyond. They move deferentially around the huge malls, cafes, bars and restaurants, bowing down and calling people sir and madam. In the middle of the day, during the hottest hours, you can see them sleeping in public gardens under trees, or on the marble floors of the Dubai Mosque, on benches or pieces of cardboard on side streets. These are the victims of the racism that is not only flourishing in the UAE but is increasingly being exported to the rest of the Middle East. Sometimes it reminds you of the American south in the 1930s. </p> <p>One evening in Abu Dhabi, I have dinner with my friend Ali, a charming Iraqi engineer whom I have known for two decades. After the meal, as his wife serves saffron-flavoured tea, he pushes back his chair and lights a cigar. We talk about stock markets, investment and the Middle East, and then the issue of race comes up. </p> <p>\"We will never use the new metro if it's not segregated,\" he tells me, referring to the state-of-the-art underground system being built in neighbouring Dubai. \"We will never sit next to Indians and Pakistanis with their smell,\" his wife explains.</p> <p>Not for the first time, I am told that while the immigrant workers are living in appalling conditions, they would be even worse off back home - as if poverty in one place can justify exploitation in the other.</p> <p>\"We need slaves,\" my friend says. \"We need slaves to build monuments. Look who built the pyramids - they were slaves.\" </p> <p>Sharla Musabih, a human rights campaigner who runs the City of Hope shelter for abused women, is familiar with such sentiments. \"Once you get rich on the back of the poor,\" she says, \"it's not easy to let go of that lifestyle. They are devaluing human beings,\" she says. \"The workers might eat once a day back home, but they have their family around them, they have respect. They are not asking for a room in a hotel - all they are asking for is respect for their humanity.\"</p> <p>Towards the end of another day, on a fabulous sandy beach near the Dubai marina, the waves wash calmly over the beautiful sand. A couple are paragliding over the blue sea; on the new islands, gigantic concrete structures stand like spaceships. As tourists laze on the beach, Filipino, Indian and Pakistani workers, stand silently watching from a dune, cut off from the holidaymakers by an invisible wall. </p> <p>Behind them rise more brand-new towers. </p> <p>\"It's a Green Zone mentality,\" a young Arab working in IT tells me. \"People come to make money. They live in bubbles. They all want to make as much money as possible and leave.\" </p> <p>Back at the Mousafah camps, a Pakistani worker walks me through his neighbourhood. On both sides of the dusty lane stand concrete barracks and the familiar detritus: raw sewage, garbage, scrap metal. A man washes his car, and in a cage chickens flutter up and down. </p> <p>We enter one of the rooms, flip-flops piled by the door. </p> <p>Inside, a steelworker gets a pile of papers from a plastic envelope and shoves them into my lap. He is suing the company that employed him for unpaid wages. \"I've been going to court for three months, and every time I go they tell me to come in two weeks.\" His friends nod their heads. \"Last time the [company] lawyer told me, 'I am in the law here - you will not get anything.\" </p> <p>Economically, Dubai has progressed a lot in the past 10 years, but socially it has stayed behind,\" says Musabih. \"Labour conditions are like America in the 19th century - but that's not acceptable in the 21st century.\"</p>",
  "<p>When I meet Roseanne Barr in LA, she seems to be in a bad mood: sharp, suspicious, and complaining that her coffee isn't hot enough. Her manager has already warned me, \"You can't touch her. She has a fear of germs,\" and Barr confirms this. \"In fact I have just fear, fear of everything,\" she says, before continuing vaguely, \"I wonder what I could stand for breakfast?\" She dispatches her manager to get something she hates because she is dieting, then changes her mind. She wants: \"The 3 Ds. Dough, something dead and something dairy.\"</p> <p>Boxes piled high with scrambled eggs, meat, tortillas and a buttered bagel are spread out. I thought she could only eat small portions since having a gastric band fitted? \"Yeah,\" she says. \"I'm just trying to overfeed and I'm doing really well. Takes a lot of discipline to get 2,500 calories in there no matter how painful it is.\" </p> <p>Barr is about to bring her stand-up show to London for the first time, as part of the Big Joke comedy festival. She has been performing on stage a lot over the past few years, and has found the return to stand-up therapeutic. It was her stage act that set her on track to huge TV stardom - her eponymous show started in 1988 and ran for nine years, winning enormous ratings and a slew of Emmys as well as making her one of the most powerful women in the entertainment industry. She sees that success as where her life went wrong. The programme made her incredibly rich, but she gave most of her money away. </p> <p>Her career has been built on provocation, which makes it difficult to tell when she's being serious. \"Humanity is a failed experiment,\" she tells me, her voice becoming a monotone. \"But I think I'm God and I'd like to start over. I don't want to die, I just want everyone else to. I certainly would not be lonely. It would be exciting never having to listen to another person again but just my own self droning on and on. That's why I write a blog. And I read it too.\" She is obsessed with her blog. \"I think I should be here alone to rethink the world, I do. I want these lesser humans gone.\"</p> <p>Her monotone delivery seems designed to confuse people. Is it real? Is it for shock? \"I'm God because I have the power to control my mind,\" she explains, which makes the statement suddenly seem less extreme.</p> <p>Roseanne was born angry - the critic John Lahr once said, \"Rage is Roseanne's ozone. She creates it, she exudes it\" - and today she can sound off about most subjects. Just say the words \"Sarah Palin\" and she's away. \"She calls herself feminist but she's not. She's a careerist. I had a time in my life too when I didn't stay at home with my kids because I was on a bigger mission. She'll pay for it later though. She'll get her karma . . . In the 60s we used to say if a woman ruled the world there would be no war. But that's not right. What we mean is a thinking, conscious woman, and there's no place for any of us in this world. To make it in a man's world takes a certain kind of woman. Sarah Palin is the kind of woman they want right now.\"</p> <p>She believes that society wants women \"on anti-depressants so they are no longer creative or fierce\". Has she taken anti-depressants? \"Oh, hell yeah. There isn't anything that I haven't done. They dull your rage. People don't like angry women so they say, 'We're going to have to drug that bitch to get her to shut up. We will humiliate her and disenfranchise her, but first she has to shut up.' Oh yeah, I did those anti-depressants the last time I was famous. I needed to dull the horror of it.\"</p> <p>Barr was born 55 years ago to a poor, chaotic Jewish family in the Mormon-dominated Salt Lake City, Utah. Her father, now dead, sexually abused her when she was growing up. Her mother was traumatised by the loss of relatives in the Holocaust, and was so paranoid that she would hide with her children in the basement if anyone arrived at the house unexpectedly. When Barr was 16 she was struck by a car, nearly died, and her head injuries forced her into a mental institution for a short period. </p> <p>She says of growing up in Salt Lake City: \"You weren't supposed to think there. First of all it was frowned upon to be a girl, and second of all to be a fat, dark-haired girl who had no waist, and third to be a loudmouthed, short, fat, dark girl.\"</p> <p>Of her abusive father, she says: \"We have a great relationship now.\" But he's dead. \"Well, he's in another realm, but I talk to him and he talks to me. He guides me. He's in a place of perfection and he doesn't like what's wrong. He wants it fixed.\" Was she able to resolve her relationship with him when he was alive? \"In some ways, yes. I tried to make peace with my dad before he died and there was a moment where it was possible, so because it was possible I claim that as having happened. We had, like, an understanding for a minute and it was forgiveness on both sides ... Everybody does something they find abhorrent in someone else, so I forgive my dad for what he did and I hope my kids will do that for me.\"</p> <p>Barr was in her late teens when she had her first daughter, Brandi, whom she gave up for adoption. They have since reunited. She married Bill Pentland, a hotel clerk, in the early 70s. They moved to Denver, lived in a trailer park and she had three more kids. As a child she had learned that the only way to survive was to be fierce and funny, so she started performing at local comedy clubs. Eventually she hit the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, where her humour offended the audience into gasping laughter. </p> <p>The sitcom was based on Roseanne's act and was about a fat, working-class couple and their children. In its heyday she used to say it made her \"more money than God but not as much as Oprah\", and the show lost its way when Roseanne's TV self won the lottery - art reflecting life. By this time she had long since split up with Pentland and married comedian Tom Arnold. She says that that \"was a horrible dysfunctional relationship in a time of my life that was the worst ever\". Each week there were new tabloid headlines about the couple, and they posed for a Vanity Fair cover photograph naked and mud wrestling - a metaphor for their relationship.</p> <p>Around this time she had cosmetic surgery: a breast reduction, tummy tuck, her nose made more kitty-cat. Did she hope the surgery would make her feel better? \"All I know is I sure like those pain pills,\" she says. \"I think that's why I had all that surgery. Every time I had a break I would have surgery. I think just to get away from him [Arnold] and then when I came back there'd be nurses in the house and I wouldn't be alone with him.\" </p> <p>After leaving Arnold, she married former bodyguard Ben Thomas, and they had a son, Buck, now 13. That marriage is over too, and nowadays she seems happy, if that is possible for a person so defined by her rage. \"I like to shop, to buy cards, I like to take photographs, to grow things, to cook, to blog, and to talk to my boyfriend.\" Her current partner is Johnny Argent, whom she met in 2002, after running a writing competition on her blog. She softens when talking about him. \"My boyfriend and I are kindred spirits. He is feminine in a way. When he used to write for me he lived in the desert. He was like a hermit just with his books.</p> <p>\"We talked for a year on the phone. I fell in love with his voice. I told him, 'I don't care if you're an amputee, I just care if you have teeth' - teeth are pretty important. I don't mind about the no limbs and stuff. He kept saying, 'You won't like how I look, you'll be very disappointed.' He would never send a picture so I thought, 'He's Quasimodo, but I don't care.' Then we made an arrangement to meet. He flew in and I was waiting at the airport in a car with a driver. He's crazy like me, he doesn't go outside very much. I was thinking, 'Why have I done this?' and he opened the door and I almost lost my mind. He was the most handsome man I've ever seen.\"</p> <p>She wants to show me what he looks like so we go to her computer and she trawls through all the photographs. He's tall, chiselled, elegant, with lustrous grey hair. There are photos of her daughters, her sons, her mother, and of a Roseanne doll that her daughter made. The doll is holding a bottle of wine, a sausage and some cheese. There's also a picture of a white Persian cat with her face on it. She says she has a fear of cats because she thinks she was one in another life. \"I can't have cats around me because they try to steal my energy.\" </p> <p>Barr says that she's excited to do stand-up again. \"I've been doing it 30 years. I ought to be pretty good. I do it because it gives me a channel for all those obsessive thoughts. My head goes so fast so I just handle all the shit and send it to a place where it's supposed to go and not drive me crazy ... Right now I'm channelling it into sewing outfits for Christmas presents. Most of all I'm trying to pursue not pursuing things.\" And with that she reopens the takeaway box and toys with what is left of her tortilla.</p> <p>\u2022 Roseanne Barr's stand up show will be at the Leicester Square Theatre in London on October 21 and 22.

  "<p>A revenue and customs exhibition might not seem like the location of choice for teenagers looking for inspiration for their first film script. But throw a collection of seized weaponry - including a sub-machine gun, \"ninja death-stars\" and exploding darts - into the equation, and things get more interesting.</p> <p>Since May, an exhibition called Seized! Revenue &amp; Customs Uncovered, at the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool, has been displaying a selection of the weapons seized at UK borders. It's a handful of the \"huge collection\" of dangerous arms and other contraband materials the museum holds.</p> <p>The exhibition is also being used to help schools and local youth groups run weapons awareness training. Museum staff are leading workshops with groups of teenagers about the weapons and are running projects on personal safety and gun and knife crime. It will soon be extended to younger children.</p> <p>Mary Roberson, education and programmes officer for the exhibition, says: \"The role of customs is to stop these weapons coming in, so we look at the laws around weapons, what is considered a weapon, and why these laws exist, and hope it leads on to bigger debates that touch on the moral and safety dilemmas for young people who are making their own judgments about knife and gun crime.\"</p> <p>Judith Pool, a local drama teacher whose group of students, aged 14-17, have already attended the awareness training, says: \"The danger was that the experience would somehow glamorise the weapons on display, but the collection actually kickstarted a whole debate among the students about the ethics of carrying guns, why people feel the need to have a weapon, and personal safety.\"</p> <p>Pool says the collection of contraband fake designer goods also helped start a wider discussion about the crime and violence funded by a \u00a310bn trade in counterfeit goods in the UK. </p> <p>After visiting Seized, Pool's students wrote a short film about the impact of the UK gun trade on families, told through the eyes of two childhood friends. \"There is so much awareness of knife and gun crime among young people at the moment and it sometimes feels like we're deluged by projects aimed at dissuading young people from carrying weapons,\" Pool says. \"But this actually provided a fresh perspective.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Details at: <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/3gtzup\">tinyurl.com/3gtzup</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/rafael-benitez\">Rafael Ben\u00edtez</a> is still waiting to be approached by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool's </a>American owners over a new contract, nine months after Tom Hicks revealed his intention to extend the Spaniard's stay at Anfield.</p> <p>Despite overseeing an impressive start to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> campaign - the side lie second to Chelsea on goal difference - and progressing to the lucrative group phase of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> for the fifth time in five seasons as Liverpool manager, Ben\u00edtez has received no word on a contract extension.</p> <p>The issue did not arise when the Liverpool manager met George Gillett, Hicks' co-owner, before and after the league victory over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchesterunited\">Manchester United</a> at Anfield last month and there are no plans in place to open negotiations.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez's deal expires at the end of next season and while that offers ample time to negotiate a new contract for the 48-year-old, who wishes to extend his Anfield reign, the delay is a further illustration of the impasse which exists among the Liverpool hierarchy and the uncertainty that it brings to long-term planning at the club. Although Hicks wants to offer the manager at least a 12-month extension, he cannot do so without the agreement of Gillett or acquiring majority control of Liverpool. The Texan has neither at present.</p> <p>\"I would prefer to have a long-term contract and then you can have a long-term plan,\" said Ben\u00edtez, who was last night encouraged by news that the defender Martin Skrtel should be back by Christmas from the knee injury he sustained on Sunday at Manchester City. \"All managers need time but it is more difficult to get that now.</p> <p>\"All managers are in the same situation. The problem in England now is that everyone wants to be successful too soon. That is the part of the game I don't like. But I'm really pleased to be here and I have two more years left on my contract, so right now I'm just trying to do my job as best I can. I've always said I want to stay here for many years.\"</p> <p>It was in January that Hicks revealed plans to extend Ben\u00edtez's contract, having sparked outrage among Liverpool supporters by approaching J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann about the Spaniard's job, with Gillett, two months earlier. He followed that up in April by stating: \"If I were to buy George out the first thing I would do is offer Rafa a one-year extension to make sure he is going to be here up to when we get the stadium. Hopefully we could have some success and then extend him again.\"</p> <p>Both Liverpool's new stadium and Hicks' hopes of purchasing just 1% of Gillett's stake have since stalled indefinitely, with the global economic crisis cited for the construction delay and Gillett preferring to sell up to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The ruler of Dubai has not conceded defeat in his exhaustive attempt to purchase Liverpool but the Americans' valuation of the club remains far in excess of what he is prepared to pay.</p> <p>With Liverpool enjoying the best start to a season under his management, however, Ben\u00edtez is determined to keep off-field distractions to a minimum: \"I'm not really worried about the situation at the moment. I am trying to be pragmatic about it and am just concentrating on the things I can improve. It doesn't make it more difficult for me to plan for the future. I can only control things on the pitch, improve the squad, and if I can do that then things will be easier in the future.\"</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez was relieved to discover Skrtel is expected to be sidelined for little more than two months. The Slovakian visited a specialist yesterday and was informed that knee surgery is unnecessary.</p>",
  "<p>The mayor of London (Johnson defends decision to oust Met chief, October 4) has set a precedent that should promote debate before the proposals in the green paper on policing, published in July, are enshrined in law. His actions have already led one clear favourite to succeed Ian Blair - Norman Bettison, chief constable of West Yorkshire - to announce that he will not be a candidate, citing \"political expediency\". There will be more who take a similar view.</p> <p>Police authorities already have the means to oust chief officers simply by not renewing their contracts. Furthermore, in the case of London, the mayor appoints over half of the 23 members of the Metropolitan Police Authority, arrangements that the government seems content with, as it does not propose to amend them in the green paper. So providing Boris Johnson appoints like-minded individuals, he will always have the whip hand if there are differences over policing issues with the chief officer. </p> <p>In the green paper, the government proposes to directly elect most members of police authorities outside of London, in an attempt to enhance local accountability. These people will be called crime and policing representatives and it is envisaged that political parties will endorse candidates. What would the effect be, if, say, the BNP was successful in endorsing representatives?</p> <p>Johnson has usurped the tripartite structure (police authority/home secretary/chief officer), the three-legged stool that has been in place since the 1964 Police Act, and has stood the test of time. Before we endorse the proposals in the green paper, we now must carefully reflect on the ramifications of the events of last week. If we don't, we are likely to see more quality candidates like Bettison deterred from seeking this and other high-profile policing jobs, with catastrophic consequences.<br><strong>Peter Williams</strong><br>Senior lecturer in policing, University of Teesside </p> <p>Ken Livingstone's and Jacqui Smith's defence of Ian Blair is in support of the cover-ups on finance, police shootings and racism.

  "<p>While much of the attention in the US election focuses on the daily verbal clashes between John McCain and Barack Obama, a battle is being fought with as much intensity on the ground involving tens of thousands of lawyers and campaign staff.</p> <p>In courtrooms in Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Georgia, Michigan, Florida, Wisconsin and other states, lawyers representing Democrats and civil liberties groups are locked in fights with Republicans over who is allowed to vote.</p> <p>The Republicans say they are only trying to prevent voter fraud. The Democrats, burnt by what happened in Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004, say they are trying to ensure the Republicans do not steal the election by making it difficult for poor whites, African-Americans, the young and other potential Democratic voters to cast their ballots.</p> <p>If Obama is heading for a landslide as the polls suggest, the issue could be academic in terms of the final result. But if the poll gap narrows over the next few weeks it could be critical. An academic study of the 2000 vote estimated that 2 million people were not allowed to cast their ballots, more than those who lost their votes through the much-publicised faulty voting machines.</p> <p>Laughlin McDonald, who takes the lead on voting rights for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is at the forefront of the registration battles, said yesterday it was possible that registration challenges by Republicans could match or outstrip those in 2000 and 2004. The increased interest in the election because of Obama on the part of African-Americans and the young could result in the biggest turnout in US election history and also increase the scope for voter suppression.</p> <p>\"There always is a problem with voter registration but we are seeing more of it than in the past ... I can only say we've gotten more calls and are investigating more cases than before,\" McDonald, author of several books on voting rights, said.</p> <p>Unlike most of Europe, where the mechanics of voting is not in party hands, the US process is left to state governments, and the parties in power often exploit this advantage. Democrats claim that rules introduced since 2004 in Republican-run Georgia, Indiana and Florida require specific pieces of ID that are unnecessary given there is little recent history of double-voting. They say the changes are politically motivated, aimed at African-Americans, Latinos, the young and other groups that tend to vote Democrat.</p> <p>Indiana and Georgia are asking for driving licences that include photographs, but that could discriminate against people without cars. A recent study found that while 80% of Americans have cars, only 22% of African-Americans do.</p> <p>There is the prospect on election day, as a result of the heightened interest, of huge queues, and this could be exacerbated by Republican activists mounting challenges over IDs. Lengthy queues could dissuade some from staying to vote. In 2004 some people had to queue in African-American neighbourhoods for two to three hours in Ohio, a state that Bush won by a slim margin.</p> <p>There have been several successful legal challenges in Ohio this year, including one last month that overturned a 2006 law that required a piece of registered mail to be sent to every voter in the state. Mail was not forwarded and anyone whose name appeared on the list as mail returned could be challenged on voting day, a process known as cageing. If it had been allowed to stand an estimated 600,000 people would have been disenfranchised.</p> <p>Professor Daniel Tokaji, of Ohio State University's Moritz college of law, who specialises in election law and has been involved in legal actions in defence of voter rights, said: \"There is a major systemic problem in the US. The people running the election have a stake in the election. It is the quintessential problem. If you had to design a system from scratch, you would not do this.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There are occasional examples of suppression involving Republican-leaning voters but, in the main, it is Democratic-leaning voters that are targeted.\"</p> <p>After another successful challenge that Tokaji was involved in, voters in Ohio who wanted to vote early were allowed to register and vote on the same day. The state Republican party had gone to court to block same day registration and voting.</p> <p>In Wisconsin a judge is to rule on October 23 on a lawsuit filed in August by the Republican attorney general, John Byron Van Hollen, seeking to force ID checks on 240,000 to 1 million voters in the state. </p> <p>Last month in Florida the registration applications of more than 5,000 people were held up on identity grounds. Under Florida law the name on a driving licence has to perfectly match that on the government's databank of social security numbers and names. In fact there are many spelling mistakes and mismatches, particularly in the Latino community, who sometimes use shortened versions of their names on social security cards and revert to their longer family names for driving licences. Even minor differences can provoke challenges.</p> <p>In Florida's Orange County more than 50% of the 672 challenged registrations were Democrats and only 10% Republicans. The Republicans say the discrepancy is because of the much bigger Democratic registration drive this year.</p> <p>One of the big demographic groups being targeted in states across the US is university students, among whom Obama enjoys support over McCain of at least two to one. Given potential confusion over whether they vote in the state in which they study or are from originally, there is a danger many will find themselves purged from voter lists.</p>",
  "<p>This is the climax to August Wilson's monumental, 10-play cycle about African-American experience. And even if the mechanism is a bit shaky, the play is extremely timely, with the US election only a month away. It argues both that black political advancement depends upon a respect for law, and that white people have a sneaky way of changing the rules whenever their residual power base is threatened.</p> <p>Set in Pittsburgh in 1997, the play shows how Hammond Wilks aspires to be the city's first black mayor, while also driving through a massive redevelopment project in the decrepit Hill district. But Wilks' plans are threatened by a pesky old-timer who claims that a house standing on the development site is legally his. Wilks's business partner argues that they should demolish and be damned. Wilks himself initially takes the same line, but is eventually taught a vital lesson in civic and private morality.</p> <p>The dramatic flaw is that Wilks's change of heart is prompted not just by his instinctive integrity, but by a familial bond with the unbudgeable house-owner. Wilson writes, however, with exemplary vigour about the traps confronting ambitious African-Americans in a white-dominated world: in particular, about the way they can be used as liberal camouflage by dodgy entrepreneurs. As always, Wilson also creates generous parts for actors, which are gratefully seized in Paulette Randall's production. Danny Sapani exudes a massively troubled authority as the would-be mayor, while Joseph Marcell is all bubbling eccentricity as the property owner. Wilson is a very traditional dramatist, but no one has charted better black America's social progress and the obstacles confronting it.</p>",
  "<p>It's probably because her work is so revealing that, talking to writer-director Polly Teale, you find yourself wondering what she isn't saying. It's not that she is uncommunicative; she is friendly and chatty, with a ready, raucous laugh. But her sentences often change direction, or drift into silence as she contemplates a buried thought. Sharing lunch with her during a break in rehearsals for her new play, Mine, I almost wished an actor would pop out from behind the sofa and start miming the contents of Teale's mind.</p> <p>The plays she writes and directs for Shared Experience, the company she co-runs with Nancy Meckler, are among the most distinctive in British theatre. Her vibrantly physical productions express in movement what people can't or won't say in words. </p> <p>\"One of the reasons we go to the theatre,\" she says, \"is to see the part of ourselves that is normally hidden made visible. I'm fascinated by the contradiction in characters, between what they reveal and what's going on inside. On stage, you can see real and interior worlds at the same time, which I don't think you can do in any other medium.\"</p> <p>Previously, Teale's work with Shared Experience has focused on \"stories that are huge and universal and timeless\": notably, adaptations of Jane Eyre and War and Peace, and her biographical plays about the Bront\u00eb sisters and the writer Jean Rhys. But her new play is atypical in that it is set in the modern world. Teale wanted to explore \"this gap between rich and poor that seems to be widening\", and settled on a story about a wealthy couple trying to adopt a child. The baby's birth mother is a drug-addicted prostitute; and yet for the couple, Teale argues, \"money is a kind of drug. Underneath their apparently enviable life, there is a sense of alienation and inadequacy. It throws up questions about who is really fit to parent the child.\"</p> <p>The play has its roots in the experiences of Teale's friends: two couples who successfully adopted babies that had been taken away from mothers deemed unable to parent them. Teale found herself both \"moved by my friends' courage and commitment, because there is a possibility that the baby will go back to the birth mother, and very affected by the struggle and loss of the mother, who obviously wants to keep the baby\".</p> <p>She has written before about the separation of mothers and children, in After Mrs Rochester. Jean Rhys, its subject, abandoned her daughter for a period, and also witnessed the death of her three-week-old son. And separation is a subject horribly close to Teale's heart. Her daughter, Eden, was born premature, at 28 weeks, and spent her first three months in an incubator. Eden had a twin brother who died in hospital, aged nine months. It was, says Teale, \"a very tough beginning, very scary beginning\" to Eden's life and to her own as a mother. She admits that \"the fear of the couple in Mine - of the loss of the baby and whether it's going to be all right - relates to that time\".</p> <p>Work helped Teale cope. While her son was in hospital, she spent two days a week in a rehearsal room, helping Meckler to revive Shared Experience's adaptation of George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss. \"I remember thinking, 'Do I want to do this?' But there was something about going out into the world, and focusing on something else, which I was quite grateful for.\" Conversely, the 46-year-old now loves the way Eden, aged eight, can distract her from work. \"Part of me gets home and thinks, 'God, I wish I could just sit and do nothing.' But then another part of me gets excited about seeing her, and engaging with this little person. It takes you right out of the rehearsal room, and that's healthy.\"</p> <p>Rehearsing Mine has been unusually difficult because Eden's father, the theatre director Ian Rickson, has been in New York, taking his production of The Seagull to Broadway. The couple met almost 20 years ago. Rickson was working at Paines Plough when Teale popped in to the theatre company's office to drop off a play. Getting together was \"a bit of a journey\": at the time, Rickson had a partner and a three-year-old son. Teale enjoyed being a stepmother: \"You have all the pleasure without the responsibilities.\"</p> <p>She has been surprised by the way motherhood \"can trigger your fears. I thought I'd be quite laid-back. Then you realise that a part of you gets activated that is anxious and insecure.\" Having a child, she says, \"is like having a part of yourself that's outside of you\". The play is in some ways a cautionary tale to herself, \"against the desire to be in control, and wanting things to look a certain way\".</p> <p>Teale has wanted to work in theatre since childhood, admitting with some embarrassment that she would make up plays at home, sometimes roping in one of her three siblings. No one else in the family is involved in theatre: her father was a physicist, her mother a former fashion designer who became a marriage guidance counsellor. </p> <p>Though she acted at school, Teale realised at university in Manchester that she was too self-conscious to carry on with it. \"I felt like a pantomime character, but somehow I couldn't step out of it.\" So she switched to writing and directing. Her first play demonstrated her preoccupation with the conflict between external and internal lives: it revolved around two twins, each with an on-stage alter ego. Her friend, the playwright Helen Edmundson, was in the cast, and the duo have worked together on and off ever since. But Teale doesn't think she has the temperament to be a full-time writer: \"I need to get together with other people and hear things come to life.\"</p> <p>She reads her work-in-progress to Rickson, which is \"incredibly useful, although sometimes a bit fraught\". And she shares everything with Meckler, who has been equal parts friend, colleague and mentor during their </p> <p>17-year working relationship. They first met when Teale sent Meckler a note to say how moved she had been by one of her productions. \"Lo and behold, she rang me up about three days later and said, 'Do you want to come in and meet me?' I now know how unlikely that is.\" </p> <p>Although she has a strong sense of how she wants her productions to look and feel, Teale says she can never wholly predict how they might turn out. \"Directing is like excavating something that is three-quarters underground, slowly digging it up and starting to see what it is,\" she says. \"I came up with this metaphor the other day: it's a bit like when you go to a foreign country. You read all the guidebooks, and think about what it might be like, but it's not until you get there that you have any idea.\"</p> <p>That sounds like many people's experience of parenthood, too. Teale's analogy for the moment when a production steps out of the rehearsal room and comes under the scrutiny of audiences and critics is equally telling. \"It's like having a baby that you're so engaged and involved with, then somebody comes along and says, 'What's the funny mark on her cheek?' or 'Her eyes are a bit close together, aren't they?' And of course that's how it is.\"</p> <p><strong>Mine</strong> is at the Hampstead Theatre, London NW3 (020-7722 9301), October 7-25, then tours. <br></p>",
  "<h2>Chilli con carne</h2> <p>Leon's take on the original uses braised-to-the-point-of-falling-apart chunks of beef chuck rather than mince, which is what most people would expect. The benefit is that there's more flavour in the bigger pieces, and if we all had a bit more time in the world I'm sure more people would choose to do it like this.

  "<p>A jury yesterday convicted a police constable of careless driving, then sent a note to the trial judge accusing his force of \"institutionalised complacency\" for allowing a poorly managed high-speed training exercise on a country lane which resulted in a fatal collision.</p> <p>PC Sean Schofield, 38, an advanced driver with Lancashire police, had been at the wheel of a high-performance Volvo T5 travelling at speeds of up to 104mph during the training exercise on a winding B road. He crossed on to the wrong side of the road at 94mph and crashed the vehicle on a bend, killing retired academic Peter Williams and injuring his wife, Jean.</p> <p>The impact of the collision in November 2006 on the B6254 near Over Kellet, Carnforth, which had a 60mph speed limit, shunted the couple's VW Touran backwards and spun it 180 degrees.</p> <p>Schofield, who was acquitted of causing death by dangerous driving, was testing in-car Vascar equipment. This involved him chasing a car driven by trainer PC Andrew Massingham to register its speed. </p> <p>The jury's note, which the judge said he fully endorsed, read: \"The course was flawed by poor management, poor design and poor preparation from the highest level. We believe the Lancashire police force were guilty of institutionalised complacency with regards to training and driving at high speeds on open, public roads. </p> <p>The jurors went on to make suggestions for all police forces: no training to exceed national speed limits on A-D roads unless they are closed to the public; training routes should be identified and risk assessed; and a risk assessment should be carried out for Vascar training.</p> <p>Massingham was acquitted of causing death by dangerous driving and did not face the alternative charge. There was also a message for him from the jurors: \"We believe that PC Massingham ... was also guilty of careless driving and shares the responsibility for this tragic accident,\" they said. Ten months after the crash, he was banned from driving for 28 days when he was caught driving at 92mph.</p> <p>Williams, 67, who was travelling from his home in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, for a short break with his wife in the Yorkshire Dales, died in hospital the next day. His widow, Jean, 65, told the court she saw two police cars hurtling towards them, recalling how one appeared to wobble, lose control and cross to the wrong side of the road, on to a grass verge and then back on to the road. Peter Williams was faced with an impossible choice because he \"literally had nowhere to go\". </p> <p>Nicholas Johnson, prosecuting, said: \"The inevitable followed: a high-speed, high-impact, head-on collision.\"</p> <p>Schofield and a colleague, PC Jason Colclough, who was not charged, were being instructed in how to use a Vascar speed gun from a moving vehicle. Both officers were injured. The prosecution said it would have been obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous. The speed was \"unsuitable and dangerous for the B road on which they were travelling,\" Johnson said. </p> <p>Later, Schofield insisted to investigating officers that he had been travelling at a safe speed, and that Williams's car had been on the wrong side of the road. In evidence, Massingham said: \"I was in charge of the course. I found out the following day that Mr Williams had died and it is a difficult burden to carry.\"</p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would seek urgent discussions with Lancashire police about the findings of their investigation and if \"there will be any disciplinary matters relating to the two officers\".</p>",
  "<p>An unemployed man who once worked for a big accounting firm killed his wife, three children, mother-in-law and then himself because he was despondent over his financial problems, police said yesterday. </p> <p>Police found the bodies on Monday after Karthik Rajaram's wife, Subasri, 39, failed to show up at work. The deaths occurred sometime after Saturday evening.</p> <p>A handgun was found in the 45-year-old's grasp in the house in a gated community in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, said a deputy police chief, Michel Moore.</p> <p>Police found two suicide notes and a will. They also determined that Rajaram had an MBA from the UCLA and once worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers and for Sony Pictures. </p> <p>But he had been unemployed for several months and his finances had reached a crisis point in recent weeks, Moore said. </p> <p>\"This is a perfect American family ... that has absolutely been destroyed, apparently because of a man who just got stuck in a rabbit hole, if you will, of absolute despair. It is critical to step up and recognise we are in some pretty troubled times.\"</p> <p>In the suicide note Rajaram wrote he had two options, to kill himself or to kill himself and his family, and decided the second was more honourable, Moore said. Police found his mother-in-law, Indra Ramasesham, 69, dead on the ground floor and the bodies of Subasri, Karthik and their three children, Krishna, 19, Ganesha ,12, and Arjuna, 7, upstairs.</p> <p>Moore did not give details on the family's financial problems, but noted that the family did not own their home outright. </p> <p>It was reported that Rajaram made more than $1m in 2001 from an investment.</p>",
  "<p>There's a received wisdom that Greens don't do well in a recession. As the threat of unemployment pushes the environment out of voters' minds, green issues take a back seat. So it has proved in every recession. Except this one.</p> <p>I became leader of the Green party just two days after one of the most far-right administrations in US history was forced to nationalise nearly half of the country's mortgage market. The financial crisis we are entering has variously been described as the worst since 1978, '47, '33 and '29. And yet the Greens are continuing to climb in the opinion polls. </p> <p>People are coming to the realisation that the system of globalised markets - unregulated, unpoliced and unguided - is fatally flawed. Everyone agrees that we need to confront the failed corporate control of our economy, and restore it to democratic control. Everyone, that is, except the establishment parties in Westminster.</p> <p>Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have, bizarrely, chosen this moment to converge in support of the kind of neoliberalism that has caused this crisis in the first place. In doing so, they have abandoned not only common sense but also the majority of voters.</p> <p>Conversely, the Green party has seriously got to grips with the economic situation and is delivering practical solutions. We are more confident than ever in destroying the myth that we are a single-issue party. We are stepping into the gap left by parties that are now opposition in name only, exposing the economic and social failings of the establishment.</p> <p>The alternative we are providing is practical. Gordon Brown spent days haggling with energy barons to deliver a half-hearted, excessively means-tested response to fuel poverty. In Kirklees, Yorkshire, Green councillors delivered a universal free insulation scheme that will slash the bills of 40,000 households, while also creating jobs, providing training, and cutting carbon emissions.</p> <p>At national level too, Greens are helping to set an agenda for change. With a group of eight others, including the Guardian's Larry Elliot, I have co-authored a proposal for a Green New Deal to tackle what is, in reality, a 'triple crunch': economic recession, accelerating climate change, and rising oil prices underpinned by an encroaching peak in oil production.</p> <p>Like Roosevelt, who launched his New Deal during the Great Depression of the 1930s, we need to end the fairytale that the economy can look after itself, and all of us, through trickle-down and the invisible hand. The Green New Deal calls for the re-regulation of finance and taxation, cracking down on tax evasion, and de-merging the mega-banks into more containable entities, closer to the real economy, with retail banking separated from high finance. </p> <p>It also means investment in the infrastructure of tomorrow's economy. For 1930s America, that meant bridges and agricultural colleges. With climate change and peaking oil production, what we need today are home insulation, public transport and renewable energy. A 21st-century project to make the nation's buildings truly energy efficient, together with a revolution in renewable energies, would secure our energy supplies into the future, protect us against oil price fluctuations, re-invigorate our manufacturing sector and seriously address climate change.</p> <p>In addition to government funding, inducements for private investments from pensions and other savings would be introduced, to generate thousands of high-quality, green-collar jobs, revitalise money flows, loosen ties to unreliable oil markets and cut carbon emissions. </p> <p>The Green party is poised to send MPs to Westminster for the first time. In Brighton Pavilion, where I am standing, the most recent election results show we are now ahead of all the other parties. The same is true in Norwich South, where Adrian Ramsay, is on course to unseat Charles Clarke. And in Lewisham-Deptford, the deputy chair of the London Assembly, Darren Johnson, has turned one of the safest Labour seats in the country into a key battleground. It's my priority as leader to make sure we communicate to people that there is an alternative to a drab, fatalistic, neoliberal establishment.</p> <p>By offering universal free insulation to communities, we'll cut bills, create jobs, and start the work of creating a housing stock fit for a zero-carbon economy. By attacking poverty and pay, we'll address the inequality that blights lives - and stimulate the economy at the same time. </p> <p>\u2022 Caroline Lucas is leader of the Green party and a Green MEP.</p>",
  "<p>Jim Thompson has just been told that there's no chance of an increase on his \u00a390 loan from the Social Fund. \"There's 35 quid left to last us another seven days,\" he says. By \"us\" he means himself, his pregnant, unemployed girlfriend Jan Mason, 27, and their 12-month-old baby, Michelle. Thompson slumps wearily over the railings at the side of Ladywood community centre in inner-city Birmingham. Then he straightens up and, for a moment, he looks the part of a 25-year-old former soldier who has served in Northern Ireland, Kosovo and Bosnia.</p> <p>\"I'd rather starve than let them go hungry,\" he adds with a defiant gesture at his family. \"We might be short of money, but we're not short of love.\" Certainly, Michelle doesn't look short of care and attention. But she will grow up in the constituency pinpointed last week as having a higher proportion of its children living in poverty than any in the UK; 81% of families in the area are struggling, which directly affects some 28,420 of its children, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/01/clare.short.child.poverty\">figures from the Campaign to End Child Poverty</a>.</p> <p>Thompson was doing comparatively well until three weeks ago, when he lost his job laying carpets for a hotel chain. \"They're not fitting out any more hotels until the economy picks up,\" he says. Next week, he might - just might - get the redundancy money he has been promised. Meanwhile, the rent is due on the family's two-bedroom flat in a nearby tower block.\"Then all I've got to find is the money for food, electricity, milk and nappies,\" he adds bitterly. \"I've been to umpteen building sites trying to get labouring work, but the construction firms are cutting back as well.\"</p> <p>So Thompson and his family become another statistic. The constituency's unwelcome reputation is based on a 45% jobless level, combined with another 36% receiving working tax credit to bolster meagre incomes. This part of Birmingham is no longer packed with factories offering comparatively well-paid work. The local government ward of Ladywood, a largely 1960s-built estate, butts right up against the canal-side apartments and restaurants of the city centre. Not far, indeed, from the International Convention Centre where the Conservative party conference gathered last week. Yet the government that Tory leader David Cameron blames for what he calls \"our broken society\" has invested hundreds of millions in a parliamentary constituency that includes not only the ward and the city centre itself but also inner-city Aston, Nechells and parts of Handsworth.</p> <p>However, its neighbourhoods have turned into what Jenny Phillimore, from the Centre for Urban and Regional Studies at Birmingham University, calls \"microcosms of super-diversity\", with constantly changing populations. \"Yes, the government had put a lot of money into regeneration, but, at the same time, Ladywood has become a reception area for immigration,\" she says.\" The poorest people come here because there's a lot of cheap, rented social housing.</p> <p>\"We've found Kurdish and African families with nine and sometimes 11 people living in two-bedroom flats. Those who are here legally are starting to bring their families in, but they're not entitled to any public funds. Without money for uniforms or bus fares, they're not sending their children to school.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, among the settled population, there's a high level of dropping out from an education system on which children depend for qualifications for any but the most menial jobs. </p> <p>Kenneth Jeffers, 55, a former education minister in Montserrat, came to Ladywood soon after a volcanic eruption on the Caribbean island in the 1990s. He spends much of his time at the Sky Rainbow Foundation, which tries to raise the horizons of black youths. \"In the Caribbean, our children's learning curve starts to improve after the age of 11,\" he says. \"Here, it seems to peak at 11 and then start to decline.\" Jeffers wants to set up exchange deals between schools in Birmingham and the West Indies.</p> <p>As it is, plenty of children are too frightened to leave their corner of Ladywood. The gun violence plaguing the area is largely based on postcode territorialism. Former social worker Udel James, 50, holds a photograph of her nephew. A fresh-faced black boy, he was shot dead for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p> <p>James's response is to set up One B Outreach, running a minibus to occasional residential weekends in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. To these youngsters - white and Asian, as well as black - it's as remote and exotic as the Caribbean. \"There's a lot of tension at first,\" James concedes. \"But, by the end of the weekend, they're all asking: 'Why do we have to go home, miss?'\" It's an understandable question in the circumstances.</p> <p>\u2022 The names of Jim Thompson and his family have been changed at his request</p>",
  "<p>Benjamin Barber has been to the White House to advise Bill Clinton on civic engagement, flown to Libya to help Colonel Gadafy shape his democratic agenda, and has travelled the globe advising political leaders on civic society. So it is perhaps strange to find America's leading political theorist in Peterborough museum speaking to the city's civic leaders about their regeneration plans. </p> <p>Perception Peterborough, a public sector alliance that includes the council and the regional development agency, has enlisted Barber's help in planning how the city balances business and population growth. The 69-year-old professor led a series of seminars on the issue last month, and Peterborough's grand vision will be unveiled on October 22. With 16,000 eastern European migrants moving to the city since the EU expansion in 2004, and a \u00a31bn regeneration programme planned, it is all worthy stuff. But isn't he a tad overqualified for the job?</p> <p>Not at all, Barber insists. \"I worked with President Clinton, I worked with Howard Dean at the Democratic party, I worked with the German Social Democratic party, and I'm working now with Gadafy, but my deep interest in democracy means I do a lot of work at the neighbourhood and community level, where you feel that your ideas are more valuable and are taken more seriously than with the world leaders.\"</p> <p>It is timely that the veteran academic is advising on UK civic policy, given the renewed national focus on community issues from both the Tories and Labour. For more than three decades, Barber has argued that democracies rely on civil society - family, communities and voluntary organisations - as \"the free space in which democratic attitudes are cultivated and democratic behaviour conditioned\". He is president and director of the international pro-democracy charity CivWorld, and his 17 books include 1995's Jihad vs McWorld, a bestselling tome about how global corporations as well as traditional cultures threaten democracy. </p> <p>He waxes lyrical about Peterborough's public spaces, the pedestrianised shopping areas, and the market squares that remind him of the university city of Heidelberg in Germany. He admires the community's involvement in the city's future, with interest from residents, councillors, developers and housing organisations. \"My ultimate interest is not about presidents but in democracy,\" he stresses. \"And democracy is about people being empowered to take charge of their own lives and share in the powers that affect them. That is exactly what I see the potential for in Peterborough.\"</p> <p>Barber is the best known of the experts helping shape Peterborough's future. The others include Jan Gustav Strandenaes, environmental adviser to the UN, and Thailand-based community architect Patama Roonrakwit. The public sector is somewhat bereft of celebrities, but Barber has what can only be described as star power. Not many of his counterparts, for example, are mobbed by glad-handing fans (\"You're a star, Benjamin!\" exclaims one wide-eyed council officer). He is an impressive speaker, delivering a verbal tour de force at a machine gun pace and moving seamlessly from city centres to the philosophies of great thinkers such as Alexis de Tocqueville and John Stuart Mill, before winding up with an anecdote about Clinton.</p> <p>Ask Barber how he thinks the economic meltdown affects society, and his exasperation with \"the market\" is tangible. The crisis, he storms, is due partly to erosion by politicians of citizenship in favour of rampant consumerism. \"[Politicians say:] 'You need to stop being citizens and start being consumers! Tell us what you want. You want a house? You want to buy more?' We've seen in this economic meltdown the bankruptcy of the idea that we don't need citizens. What citizens would have done, had they involved themselves in this, would have been to insist on regulatory oversight and democratic surveillance. As citizens, we would have been able to contain the forces that have led to the meltdown.\" </p> <p>But all hope is not lost, as Barber suggests that the crisis might spark a civic renaissance. \"Just as the surrender to the myth of markets has created this meltdown, a reinvigoration of citizenship and civic pride, a belief in communities, can be part of creating a new foundation for democratic institutions,\" he says.</p> <p>In the 1990s, when Clinton was fresh to the White House and Barber was his informal adviser on democratic ideas, the professor felt then too that America was on the cusp of a civic revolution. At the time, he declared that the country was \"swinging back into an era of extraordinary opportunity\" for people who care about democracy and citizenship and think they are the key to the American future. Clinton's promise was never quite fulfilled, thanks to the Monica Lewinsky affair, and, as Barber asserts, the president's \"yielding to market ideology\". </p> <p>However, he paints a flattering picture of the ex-president in his 2001 book Clinton, The Truth of Power, admiring his \"intelligence, political savvy, and his remarkable personal charm\". It is impossible to imagine Barber ever being nervous, but his first encounter with the then president of the US left him stammering and unable to articulate his thoughts on civic responsibility. So how disappointed was he when the Clinton regime imploded in scandal? \"He squandered his charisma and power in fooling around with women,\" Barber says. \"What bothered me much more was his succumbing to the market mythology, because he had really embraced and stood for the civic ideology.\"</p> <p><strong>Off the map</strong></p> <p>In Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, Barber sees another opportunity \"to talk about community and responsibility\". He admires Republican candidate John McCain's ethic of service, but \"the problem is he sees it through the lens of the military\". Meanwhile, his dislike of McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, is clear: \"She's about Alaska and about business - she's off the map.\"</p> <p>Of UK policymakers' current focus on empowerment, Barber says there is much consultation, but citizens are not active stakeholders. \"They have the language, but not the reality. Look at the term 'community kitties'. It sounds like an allowance. It's very patronising.\" Compared to the federalised, devolved form of government in the US, Barber says the UK's \"unitary centralised state\" comes off worse.</p> <p>So does he have any advice on community issues for the prime minister? The plan for a youth centre in every community, for example, should mean professionals helping young people to shape the plans, rather than just creating the buildings for them. </p> <p>Barber's response is: \"Stop consulting, stop doing outreach, and start empowering. Start saying: 'You decide how you want to do it and what you want to do, and we'll support you.'\" </p> <p>Unlike some theorists, Barber outlines practical action to support his beliefs. Civic society, he says, needs public spaces, public art, civic use of IT and telecommunications, and a curb on the use of advertising that targets children. The charge by some critics that Barber's notions are utopian aggrieves him. \"I spend a lot of time working out how to make things politically relevant,\" he says. \"I think I am one of the few public intellectuals who actually has thought a fair amount about how you make ideas work.\"</p> <p><strong>Civic mantra</strong></p> <p>Given that Barber has championed his civic mantra since the 1970s, does he ever get frustrated that his theories are not widely adopted? </p> <p>He smiles, and replies: \"It used to frustrate me, but one virtue of growing older is that you get wiser, and one piece of wisdom is that we humans are all frail, that finding solutions to our challenges is difficult. I cut people more slack - myself included - than I once did.\" He says he concentrates on positive developments, such as the fact that Gadafy is becoming \"a poet of democracy\", and at least UK politicians are trying to work out how to empower citizens. Democracy, he says, demands patience and persistence. </p> <p>Barber returns to the subject of Peterborough. Medium-sized towns and cities, he says, are \"small enough to be rooted and connected and for people to know each other, but large enough to have transportation links to feel they are part of '' global world\". </p> <p>He is optimistic about the city's future. \"If it cannot happen here, I'm not sure it can happen at all,\" he says. \"Come the civic revolution, all eyes will be on Peterborough.\"</p> <h2>A life less ordinary</h2> <p>Self-proclaimed \"public intellectual\", author, scholar, public speaker, educational and political consultant - to leaders such as Muammar Gadafy - and playwright, Benjamin Barber was once described by the Washington Post as \"chronically busy\".</p> <p>Barber grew up in Greenwich Village, New York, and was educated at Switzerland's Albert Schweitzer College and the London School of Economics, graduating from Grinnell College, Iowa, in 1960. After an MA and a PhD in government from Harvard, he held teaching posts, including those at Princeton University, Rutgers University, and the University of Maryland, where is he currently professor of civil society.</p> <p>His famous political theory, from his 1984 book Strong Democracy, demands a participatory form of democracy, and his bestselling 1995 book, Jihad vs McWorld, catapulted him to international renown, particularly after September 11.</p> <p>Barber's other works - he has written 17 books - include Consumed: How Markets Corrupt Children, Infantalise Adults and Swallow Citizens Whole, a critique of capitalism, privatisation and consumerism, published last year.</p>",

Mail Goggles, which can be set to spring into action late at night and at weekends, asks emailers to answer a series of short mathematical posers before sending their message off.

But it's not just corrupt individuals who are responsible for these outflows: tax evasion and avoidance by multinationals cost developing countries billions of pounds a year too.</p> <p>On the same page, Larry Elliott argues that tackling \"the role of tax havens in undermining the policies of sovereign states ... will require the sort of global policy coordination so sorely lacking in recent years\". So it is astonishing that, as the UK government calls for a new global financial order based on transparency, it is seeking to have language on international tax cooperation removed from the outcome document of a key summit on financing for international development, to take place in Doha in November.</p> <p>Helping developing countries repatriate lost tax income will be an essential step if they are to build adequate, sustainable income bases in the long term.

  "<p>A computer programmer employed by Yahoo in south India is allegedly behind emails put out by the country's most-wanted Islamic terrorist group, Islamic Mujahideen, which claimed responsibility for coordinated bomb blasts in three Indian cities this summer that left more than 120 dead, police said yesterday.</p> <p>Investigators said Mohammed Mansoor Peerbhoy, 31, was the head of a \"media terror cell\" made up of \"highly qualified, computer-savvy people belonging to good and educated families\" who had drafted emails sent just before or after the blasts in Delhi, Ahmedabad in Gujarat and Jaipur in Rajasthan.</p> <p>\"The Indian Mujahideen started a media wing with software engineers,\" Rakesh Maria, joint commissioner of Mumbai police, told reporters. \"They had the technical knowledge to know to send out messages just before the blasts and after the blasts took place.\" </p> <p>Peerbhoy was one of 15 men arrested by police in Mumbai in connection with an alleged plan to bomb the city during the current holiday season. </p> <p>Peerbhoy's role - along with two other software engineers - is alleged to have been to hack into unsecured wireless internet sites in Mumbai to send emails that spoke of \"blowing apart your tourism structure ... and demolishing your [Hindu] faith in the dirty mud\".</p> <p>Police said Peerbhoy speaks good English, works with Yahoo! as a principal software engineer and takes home 1.9m rupees a year (\u00a322,600). He lives in Pune, a city in southern India known for its IT companies, and visited the US for work several times.</p> <p>He makes for an unlikely terror suspect. His father built a business as a wholesale fruit supplier to the Indian army. One brother is a doctor in the UK, another is an architect. </p> <p>According to the Hindu newspaper, Peerbhoy \"radicalised himself\" after a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2004. Other reports say he was groomed by Islamists after taking Arabic lessons.</p> <p>However in interviews with local media, Peerbhoy's family said he had been falsely implicated, calling his arrest an attempt to \"defame the Muslim community\".</p> <p>Speaking to the Times of India, a family member who did not want to be identified said: \"We don't know how he has been targeted and implicated in the case. We know that he will not do anything wrong ... Mohammed is a highly qualified person and we are a very respectable family.\"</p> <p>Others said the rash of announcements about \"Islamist masterminds\" had more to do with political pressures than justice. \"The conviction rate is less than 5% in these so-called cases,\" said Tarun Tejpal of Tehelka magazine.</p> <p>\"We simply ask, where is the evidence in these cases? What I think is happening is that we have a 24-hour hysterical media which forces politicians and police to act or to show they are acting.\"</p> <p>Mumbai police had originally said that a man called Subhan Qureshi, also known as Tauqeer, was the most wanted man in the country for sending the emails. On Monday Maria said Tauqeer was a \"media creation\".</p> <p>Yahoo said the company \"was concerned about these events and will fully cooperate with the law enforcement agencies as required\".</p>",
  "<p>China cancelled a visit to Washington by a senior general, slapped an indefinite ban on port calls by US naval vessels, and cancelled low-level diplomatic exchanges with the US yesterday, in retaliation for a US plan to sell $6.5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of advanced weaponry to Taiwan.</p> <p>China's foreign ministry in Beijing said the move broke international law and would cast a shadow over bilateral relations. The proposed sale \"has contaminated the sound atmosphere for our military relations and gravely jeopardised China's national security\", a spokesman, Qin Gang, said.</p> <p>China regards Taiwan, which has had de facto independence since 1949, as a renegade province. But its aim to unify the island with the mainland is opposed by a majority of Taiwanese. Under a 1979 law the US in effect pledged to help Taiwan defend itself against any attempt by China to forcibly acquire the territory.</p> <p>The Pentagon described China's reaction as \"unfortunate\" and said it would lead to missed opportunities. But both sides appeared anxious to limit the fallout from the row. US-China cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues in Iran and North Korea was not expected to be affected.</p> <p>The arms sale was first proposed by the US in 2001 but ran into opposition in Taiwan's parliament as well as in Beijing. It was initially valued at $12bn and potentially included Aegis-class frigates, submarines and advanced F16 fighter jets.</p> <p>The current package is less ambitious, consisting of defensive weapons systems. It includes 330 Patriot ground-to-air missiles, 30 Apache helicopters, 182 Javelin anti-tank missiles and spare parts for Taiwan's existing fleet of F16 fighters. </p> <p>China has expanded its military spending in recent years and has deployed an estimated 1,000 missiles across the Taiwan Strait, facing Taiwan.</p> <p>Prickly US relations with Taiwan have eased since the election as president last March of Ma Ying-jeou, the nationalist Kuomintang party leader and former Taipei mayor. Ma has taken steps to improve cross-straits relations, including direct charter flights, a lifting of caps on Taiwanese investment in China, and the opening of permanent representative offices in both countries.</p> <p>As a result, Chen Yunlin, the official in charge of China's Taiwan policy, is expected to visit the island soon. It would be the highest-level contact since 1949.</p>",
  "<p>Peer beyond the wreckage of western financial systems and it may be possible to discern the outlines of the future. The end of the period of \"global capital markets\" and the \"financial services revolution\" is ushering in a new era - that of social business and investment.</p> <p>With the collapse of large financial players, the very nature of unfettered financial markets is being questioned. Although the full cost of the meltdown is not yet known, we can be sure that the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.</p> <p>The banking system has been acting with an implicit state guarantee, for which the financial firms paid little - despite generating large sums for select employees and shareholders. Now that things have come unstuck, there is no recourse to the wealth that has been generated, which is a galling scenario for taxpayers. Their anger will be a feature of our political environment for many years to come.</p> <p>Another feature of the financial bailout is the massive expansion of government indebtedness, especially in the US. These debts need to be serviced, and eventually repaid. Against this backdrop, one can forget about expenditure on social programmes. </p> <p>The notion that society benefits so long as economic agents pursue pure profit-maximisation models and create wealth is now thoroughly discredited. So if the credibility of business has been seriously undermined, and government's role severely limited by resource constraints, where should we look? </p> <p>Civil society may have a role to play, but does it really possess the clout to address the scale of the problem? The answer would appear to come from an area that links all three main agents - state, private and civil - in our economy. The problem with the market-based system in its purest form was the complete absence of any social calculus. What we are now witnessing is likely to be the beginning of an economy where the full social impact of our businesses and our investments is taken into account. Signs of this trend have been evident for some time. A recent report by Eurosif, the Brussels-based trade body that encourages responsible finance, shows that, over the two years ending December 31 2007, socially responsible investment (SRI) funds in Europe have more than doubled to \u20ac2.7 trillion (\u00a32.12 trillion) - representing 17.5% of European investment assets. </p> <p>Two other asset classes with strong social return characteristics have also surged into the investment mainstream. Micro-finance has become an important feature in fixed-income portfolios, and alternative energy (\"cleantech\") is becoming a core part of equity investment. In 2007, cleantech investment amounted to roughly $150bn (\u00a3117 bn).</p> <p>At the smaller end of the scale, many new businesses have emerged, supported largely by individuals. These include retailer The Body Shop, online charity website Justgiving.com, the Ethical Property Company, which rents to social change organisations, Divine fairtrade chocolate, and a host of others. These businesses exploit the workings of the market to deliver tangible social benefits as well as financial returns. The fact that they generate financial surpluses means they are not dependent on the state or donors to conduct their activities - a very handy feature in the tough economic climate ahead. </p> <p>Charities will still play a vital role, but those dependent on state funding will be at risk. Both the voluntary sector and other civil society organisations will probably need to become more market-driven and entrepreneurial. </p> <p>Another indicator comes from leading business schools, where we can observe MBAs - a very astute, ambitious group - focusing on social business or \"social entrepreneurship\" as a potential profession. At the Judge Business School, Cambridge, I recently met a young man with a highly marketable background in bio-engineering who was \"definitely going into social business\", rather than taking the well-worn path of MBAs who sought to \"make money for 15-20 years and then give back to society\". When I asked why, his answer, without hesitation, was: \"Why waste those years?\"</p> <p>Jeremy, a friend of mine who is considered a leader in the international development field, once told me that he was taught throughout his career that the corporate sector was ill-intentioned, and that all possible solutions lie with resident experts from his world. I recall my former colleagues at Lehman Brothers saying similar things about the infinite wisdom of markets! Unlike my old Lehman friends, Jeremy is still employed. He is lucky, but also perhaps cleverer. He told me that he found that the only real solutions to today's intractable problems lie in using the wisdom of both the market and the development sector (and others).</p> <p>It is on such linkages that the social business and investment sector is based. Economic activity is an inherently \"social\" activity, and excluding social impact was bound to end in disaster. It is indeed a shame it took such a severe crisis to bring this point home. </p> <p>\u2022 Rodney Schwartz is co-founder of Catalyst Fund Management &amp; Research (<a href=\"http://www.catfund.com\">catfund.com</a>) and chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.Socialinvestments.com\">Socialinvestments.com</a>.

  "<h2>Off target</h2> <p>Measures and policies to reduce child poverty are certainly needed, but please spare us from another target, as suggested by Tom Clark (Opinion, October 1). Setting targets does nothing but encourage cheating. Faced with targets, public servants will do anything to reach the target and forget the real needs of the people they serve.</p> <p>There is no evidence of targets helping, and much to show the reverse. I suspect those involved in the recent banking collapses received performance related bonuses because they met targets.</p> <p>Some government policies have moved in the right direction, but poverty traps still exist. Tax and benefits do not mesh to help the poorest. Increasing children's disability benefits would help, but raising the income tax threshold to \u00a315,000 would be the biggest blow to poverty. The recipients might even be grateful enough to start voting Labour again.<br><strong>Roger Backhouse</strong><br>Ilford </p> <h2>No spare capacity</h2> <p>Greg Clark's enthusiasm for funding community centres and volunteering is very welcome, but he should not dismiss capacity building work so lightly (In a supporting role, October 1). People running local community groups need a lot of support. Often with no previous experience, they have to get to grips with charity law, fundraising, running buildings, planning new services, negotiating contracts and influencing the local council's policies.</p> <p>There are high expectations from politicians that community groups will help to revive local democracy and regenerate estates where government programmes over many years have had only partial success. We need a debate about how best to support community groups, but the principle of offering capacity building services in every area should not be in doubt.<br><strong>Kevin Curley</strong>, chief executive<br>National Association for Voluntary and Community Action </p> <p>Greg Clark may be Dave Cameron's man on volunteering, but I struggled to discover in your interview with him who exactly the volunteers are he has in mind. Are they idle rich do-gooders, religious organisations or, as one suspects, overworked and underpaid people who should really be doing the job as properly paid workers - if the money hadn't been spent on wars instead.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br>London</p> <h2>The future is forests</h2> <p>While it is fair for you to have an editorial opinion of \"ecologically barren conifer forests\" (Eco soundings, October 1), this blinkered approach fails to realise the true environmental value of such forests. Whether using timber as a building material or carbon-neutral fuel, it has clear environmental benefits over other construction materials or fuels. Rather than increasing the carbon footprint by importing such material, using homegrown timber has the value of reduced transport and increased rural employment, and creates internal rural economies through the growing, processing and use of the timber.</p> <p>Great strides have been taken by forest managers and timber users in recent years to enhance the ecological value of our forests without detracting from the economic potential. We already have one of the lowest percentages of forest cover in Europe, and reducing more forest to peat bog merely reduces the availability of homegrown timber to future generations.<br><strong>Jez Ralph</strong><br>Cornwall</p>",
  "<p>For those present on the day Sir Allen Stanford arrived by helicopter at Lord's, bear-hugged the bemused suits of the England and Wales Cricket Board and waved into the middle distance as if he were the president of the United States, the legal wranglings that have threatened to overshadow one of the most shamelessly commercialised showdowns in sporting history seemed somehow inevitable.</p> <p>There was every indication yesterday, following the high-court ruling in London which forced the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to back down, that Stanford would bow to the inevitable and allow Digicel, the telecom company which pumps millions of dollars each year into Caribbean cricket, to have its name on the shirts of the England players and the West Indian All-Stars in Antigua on November 1.</p> <p>But, if and when the players take the field, they must know that their tilt at financial glory has come at a price. It is one thing to insist on a potentially divisive money-match whose \"relevance\" was privately questioned yesterday by a source close to the England team. But the upshot of the power struggle between Stanford and Digicel - which feels it was forced into legal action by the Texan billionaire's intransigence over branding rights - is that the impoverished WICB, already liable for crippling court costs, is now set to miss out on its US$3.5m (\u00a32m) slice of the US$20m pie.</p> <p>While the ECB still stands to claim an identical share , its West Indian counterpart is being slapped over the wrists because it failed to foresee Digicel's objection to the involvement of its rival, Cable &amp; Wireless, in the November 1 game.</p> <p>Whether the US$3.5m still ends up finding its way into Caribbean cricket is another matter, but the process will not happen under the aegis of the board, a damaging slight to its lowly standing.</p> <p>The process which led to the high court's decision to find the WICB in breach of its contract with Digicel reveals a degree of brinkmanship that does little to contradict a point made recently by the England off-spinner Graeme Swann. \"Whenever there are large sums of money involved, it brings out the worst in people.\"</p> <p>Digicel claims its initial objections to being squeezed out of a match which it argued was made official by the involvement of the WICB - and thus necessitated its own involvement, according to its contract - were brushed aside. It is claimed that a further attempt at compromise was then rejected by Stanford, who later offered a compromise: he would pay Digicel's legal fees, try to ensure the absence of a telecom rival at the game and for the first of the five annual matches, allow Digicel free branding at the ground. </p> <p>For years two to five, Stanford was reportedly asking a price the company was unwilling to pay.</p> <p>Digicel's position going into last night's crisis talks was that it was the Stanford side which had to make the first concession. Should Digicel's name find itself on the players' shirts, then that concession will have been won. In the short term, that will save the ECB the embarrassment of having to explain to the England players why their chance to make US$1m a man has evaporated into the Caribbean heat.</p> <p>But, as ever these days, there remains the Indian issue. Sean Morris, the chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, said recently the Stanford match \"brings into question the whole status of unauthorised cricket and in the long term that will be at the heart of our relationship with the [Indian board].\"</p> <p>And while the November 1 game has been authorised by the ECB, the ruling meant it could not - at least until a way out is achieved - be sanctioned by the WICB.The Board of Control for Cricket in India, in practice a more powerful body than the International Cricket Council, is sensitive to the merest hint of unsanctioned matches because of the Indian Cricket League. The BCCI is already unhappy at the prospect of foreign players making more in three hours than they can in six weeks at the Indian Premier League. It is an irritation English cricket looks set to take on the chin.</p> <h2>Digicel dispute</h2> <p><strong>April 15, 2008 </strong>The England and Wales Cricket Board confirms it has had \"very positive\" discussions with Sir Allen Stanford about a new Twenty20 event</p> <p><strong>June 11 </strong>England sign a deal that will see them play five winner-takes-all Twenty20 matches against Stanford's Superstars in Antigua.

  "<p>West Ham's financial security is not at risk, according to one of the club's directors - despite the collapse of Iceland's second largest bank, of which the Hammers' chairman was a major shareholder.</p> <p>West Ham's chairman, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, was yesterday removed from the chairmanship of Landsbanki as Iceland's government took control in an attempt to prevent the bank falling victim to the international banking crisis.</p> <p>However, the east London club's vice- chairman, Asgeir Fridgeirsson, yesterday claimed that the chairman would not be selling the club or plundering it for cash reserves. \"He is not going to take money out of the club if that is your fear,\" Fridgeirsson said. \"He is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family.</p> <p>\"It is, of course, a blow for him and his financial strength but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honour his commitment to West Ham football club.\"</p> <p>Of far greater concern to Hammers fans and the club's manager, Gianfranco Zola, will be the vice-chairman's comments regarding any future injection of cash into the east London club.</p> <p>\"This event has limited his options for further investment this year,\" Fridgeirsson told Sky Sports News. \"We have a very big squad and our manager feels it is not necessary to be of that size, nearly 35. The money for further transfers would need to be generated from sales. There is not an intention of him to invest further in the club at the moment but the club is standing strong, generating revenues. There is a great opportunity for the club to develop further - by selling players, by buying new and developing new players.\"</p> <p>Such a sell-to-buy policy would seem to run contrary to promises made to Zola, who was told on his appointment last month that he would have funds in January. However it is unsurprising given the litany of financial woes that have befallen the club in the past month.</p> <p>Firstly their shirt sponsor, the package holiday company XL, went bust months after signing a three-year deal worth \u00a37.5m. Then an independent commission into the Carlos Tevez transfer ruled that West Ham may have to pay Sheffield United up to \u00a330m in compensation for their relegation from the Premier League at the end of the 2006-07 season, though West Ham intend to appeal that decision.</p> <p>Gudmundsson was the principal financial backer of the West Ham takeover in November 2006. He is thought to own 95% of WH Holdings, the company that purchased the club.</p> <p>Gudmundsson, Iceland's second richest man behind his son Thor, took more control of the running of the club at the start of last season, replacing Eggert Magnusson as chairman. He oversaw some drastic cost-cutting this summer, paying \u00a36m to terminate Freddie Ljungberg's contract and offloading Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney to Sunderland in an attempt to lower the club's wage bill - all of which contributed to Alan Curbishley's resignation in September two days after the transfer window closed.</p> <p>Gudmundsson and his son purchased 45% of Landsbanki for $140m in late 2002 through their investment vehicle Samson Holdings, of which the West Ham chairman owns just under 50%. Gudmundsson was also chairman of the bank, Iceland's second largest by value, until it was taken over yesterday as the country's financial system threatened to collapse and its currency plunged in value.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, may only just have found a desk in his newborn department, but he already has a crucial document to read at it. Yesterday's interim advice from the committee on climate change was short and strong: by 2050 Britain must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below 80% of 1990 levels, rather than the 60% cut now proposed in the climate change bill. This tougher target, the report says, must be written into the bill before it becomes law. On top of that, the 80% reduction needs to be made even harsher to compensate for emissions from international aviation and shipping, excluded from the existing 60% target.</p> <p>This excellent report is the first fruit of Britain's forthcoming climate change law. It comes from a committee proposed in the bill and set up at the start of the year, chaired by Lord Turner. Its report offers Mr Miliband no wriggle room. To his credit, he is not looking for any. The timing of publication is a hint that the advice will be followed. If the government had wanted to duck the challenge of an 80% target, the prime minister would not have mentioned it in his Manchester conference speech. Nor would he have created a new department to receive the report, headed by a minister who will not want to start his job by backing away from a move that Lord Turner insists is essential.</p> <p>There will soon be a series of parliamentary votes on the climate change bill, including one on a Liberal Democrat amendment that would extend the 2050 target from 60% to 80%. Mr Miliband must make it clear before then that he agrees with this - and so should the Conservative party, which has been waiting for Lord Turner's advice before deciding what to do. The prospects for political progress in Britain are good before next year's supposed global agreement at the Copenhagen summit. Opposition reshuffles, to match the new department, mean that climate change is now in the hands of three able politicians who do not want the issue to become a backwater: Mr Miliband, the Tories' Greg Clark and the Lib Dems' Steve Webb. </p> <p>Political agreement, though, will count for little unless the economics come right too. This is where there trouble lies. Yesterday the financial crisis saw Lord Turner drop his climate change hat and enter Downing Street to advise on the City meltdown instead. There has been a lot of confident talk about a market-driven response to climate change ever since Lord Stern's report argued that the costs of inaction made reducing carbon emissions economically rational. But markets are now in no position to achieve anything, rational or not. Nor are consumers likely to accept anything that pushes up their short-term costs. It was telling that the European parliament voted yesterday to ease the introduction of charges for carbon credits after 2013 - although coal-fired power generators will be charged from the start and there will be big investment in carbon storage technology. Of course a recession before then might cut carbon emissions by default. But it would also wreck the carbon trading scheme, which depends on thriving companies bidding up the price of credits they need, rather than shrinking ones selling off redundant credits to raise cash.</p> <p>The danger is that long-term targets and technological fixes will be used to disguise short-term reality. Action is needed immediately if there is any chance of a 2050 target being met - 60% or 80%. Making it as tough as possible is a virtuous thing to do. But it will mean nothing if emissions do not begin to fall. That will be a hard thing to convince voters of in a recession: Britain's last flirtation with green politics, in the late 1980s, did not last long when the economy turned sour. This time the government's commitment is more serious - and using less energy can be a way to save money. But voting for an 80% cut far in the future is the easy bit. The test is what happens now.</p>",
  "<p>Is it time to stash the tinned soup and bottled water in the cellar, along with a shortwave radio and a dagger, just in case? Just where, exactly, is this financial crisis going to end - with the collapse of the entire banking system, plunging London into a Mad Max purgatory of burnt-out cars and howling dogs, as survivors of the disaster stab each other for a last hunk of bread? </p> <p>You won't hear Robert Peston predicting that on the Today programme. But when the air is filled with talk of meltdowns and crashes, when 40% is wiped off the value of two of Britain's largest banking groups in a single day, as it was yesterday, you find yourself wondering. Not least because no one can offer certain reassurance of anything. In the past few weeks, actions once considered unimaginable have happened. There was a time when to suggest that a British government would nationalise not one but two high-street banks would have had you certified as a hopeless leftist fantasist. Now public ownership has become the norm, with the City itself and a former Conservative chancellor demanding more of it and fast. </p> <p>\"Everyone knows they're going to have to do it,\" Ken Clarke said yesterday of the proposed recapitalisation plan, expected to be part of the government package announced this morning and which would see the taxpayer buy a stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Lloyds TSB: \"Get on with it.\"</p> <p>Now nothing seems impossible. Those rapidly emptying out their accounts are doing so because they can imagine the banks crashing to the ground, taking their life-savings with them. I spoke with one financial adviser whose phone has grown hot with clients wondering whether they should move their money to Ireland. \"But what if the Irish banks collapse?\" he tells them. \"Would Ireland really have enough money to reimburse all those depositors?\" Once it seemed ridiculous to suggest a national banking system going bust. Now it's possible that an entire country could go bankrupt: look at Iceland, forced yesterday to phone Moscow begging for a loan. It's enough to make you want to shove your cash in a piggy bank, hide it under the mattress - then pull the duvet over your head and hope it all goes away. </p> <p>The instinctive response to such a situation - not that anyone under 80 has lived through anything comparable - is to look for someone to fix it. And that someone means the government.</p> <p>And yet, up till last night at least, the politicians had been floundering. Alistair Darling addressed the House of Commons on Monday in order to calm the markets and reassure the nation. Yet, as yesterday's Guardian front-page graphic cruelly illustrated, his words had precisely the opposite effect. In the 11 minutes it took him to promise that he would do \"whatever it takes\" to keep the financial ship afloat, the markets plunged. The day saw the biggest loss on the FTSE 100 since 1987. </p> <p>Ah, say the experts, but that was only because Darling had failed to say what the money men needed to hear. He came up with no specifics and, what's more is deemed weak, still in Gordon Brown's shadow and too uninspiring a communicator to persuade the neurotic men of the markets of anything. </p> <p>But there is a flaw in this conventional wisdom. Look at what happened across the Atlantic. There Hank Paulson, admired as a muscular treasury secretary, fully the master of his brief, took the most decisive action possible. No half-measures, but a $700bn bail-out aimed at mopping up the bad debts of every lender in the land. This was not the pale, pink socialism of Northern Rock or Bradford &amp; Bingley: this was red-blooded Bolshevism, seizing the commanding heights of the financial system. You gotta love the Americans: if they do something, they do it big.</p> <p>Sure, it fell at the first hurdle, defeated in the House of Representatives, but it passed eventually. And yet, did it pacify the markets? Did it persuade them that this problem was at last under control, thereby replenishing the supply of the only commodity that has actually run out during this crisis - given that there is no sudden shortage of oil or food - namely, confidence? It did not. The Dow Jones responded to the passage of the US rescue plan not by sighing with relief and declaring the trouble nearly over, but by shrugging its shoulders - and falling. That is a grim warning to Brown and Darling: whatever drastic action comes this morning might not end the turmoil.</p> <p>It's as if nothing the politicians can do is good enough. If they plug one hole in the dyke, water springs out of another. Guarantees are offered to savers in one bank or even in one country, immediately spooking those who aren't similarly covered. Even if the government in Britain did move to guarantee all bank savings, might not the panic simply move to the building societies? And once they had been dealt with at enormous cost, what's to say the insurance companies would not be next to feel the contagion of collapsed confidence?</p> <p>The result is that politicians seem dwarfed by the scale of the current crisis, either unable to act decisively at all - witness the statement of European finance ministers yesterday, agreeing on not much more than a \"coordinated framework\" for consideration of the problem - or to act decisively enough. </p> <p>It's tempting to think this is a function of the quality of our leaders. If only an FDR was around, we say to ourselves, he would surely know what to do just as he knew how to steer America through the Great Depression. And yet that might be unfair on the current generation of politicians. </p> <p>The reality is that in the balance of politics and the market, the scales tipped towards the moneymen a long time ago. The acclaimed historian of the postwar period, David Kynaston, describes as a \"fundamental revolution\" the breakdown of the old Bretton Woods system in the 1970s, ending the fixed exchange rates that had held since 1945. Once those rates could float, we entered the era of \"footloose markets\": finance could go anywhere and national governments could only look on helplessly. \"The politicians had their confidence battered,\" says Kynaston. </p> <p>In Britain, Black Wednesday in 1992 added to the politicians' timidity. New Labour, then in embryo, watched as the Major government tried and failed to control financial events, pouring money into the system, raising interest rates twice in one day - and all to no avail. Gordon Brown learned the lesson all too well: there were limits to what politicians can do. </p> <p>Now that impotence is on clear display and it is spreading alarm around the world. For people desperately want someone to get a grip. The left has been warning for years that corporations now enjoy more power than nation states, but never has it been clearer than it is now. The realisation is dawning that this is not just a financial or economic crisis, but a democratic crisis - the people and their representatives have little or no control over what affects them directly. </p> <p>The solution is surely for governments to realise that if they are weak, the high priests of high finance are even weaker. The politicians should provide the help the banks need, but with the tightest of strings attached, regulating finance so closely that it can never again gorge itself the way it has these past few years. </p> <p>Democracy has to assert itself once more - and tame this beast. <br><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\"><br>freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It is amazing how swiftly a new crisis can knock into perspective one which dominated discussion only a short time before. Just a few weeks ago we were debating whether the west was heading for a new cold war with Russia, or a new Crimean war over Ukraine, or a new Great Game in central Asia. Then the markets began their decline, and Georgia and its possible consequences were swept aside.</p> <p>But the profound sense of insecurity now felt on both sides of the old east-west divide should allow us to see Russia's Georgian intervention in a new light. It is not just that the financial crisis has hit Russia with particular force. While Russians were inspecting the new Georgian exhibit in Moscow's Museum of the Armed Forces, shares on the Moscow stock exchange were dropping like stones. Five days in October, it seemed, might turn out to be more important for everybody, including Russians, than five days in August, which is also the title of the exhibition. Russia's oil and raw material advantages suddenly look much less solid if the world economy is entering a period of low growth. And without high earnings from those commodities, the plans for military and industrial modernisation look that much more difficult to achieve.</p> <p>As the first European monitors entered the security zone around South Ossetia this week, Russian leaders and officials have been transmitting messages to their western counterparts. President Dmitry Medvedev said in St Petersburg that there was no question of a new cold war, while the Russian and American ambassadors in Washington and Moscow coauthored an article on Russo-American partnership. Former US secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz have added their plea for moderation. The silver lining of the financial crisis for Russo-western relations may conceivably be that more reasonable attitudes will in time emerge, based in part on the simple recognition that we are all in the same boat.</p> <p>While American foreign policy was undergoing its own hardening of the arteries under President Bush, Russian foreign policy was entering a period characterised by an impulse to undermine other country's projects and by a determination to reassert Russian power. Scholars such as Arne Westad, who have written on the sophistication, the common sense and the moral sensibility that marked Soviet and immediate post-Soviet foreign policy at its occasional best, have noted a loss of these qualities. What can be called a \"chessboard\" view of the world began to prevail. The Russian government and its circle of advisers do not properly understand how the United States and the European Union work, and have excluded those Russians who do. </p> <p>Every move by other countries is seen as motivated purely by self-interest, or construed as an attempt to diminish or disadvantage Russia. In the process Russia's own real interests in, for example, persuading Iran to forgo nuclear weapons were forgotten, and Russia's own weaknesses overlooked. As the evidence comes in on Georgia, those weaknesses are evident. The military operation, though successful, was also shambolic. The Russian commander got lost and field communications collapsed within hours of its start.</p> <p>In spite of the money being spent on arms, this is not the profile of a truly modernising military. The internal political context, at which Putin hinted when he seemed to imply that a failure to act over Georgia would have had consequences in the Russian part of the Caucasus, suggests another kind of weakness. Chechens spearheaded the Russian attack in Georgia, but Russia's control of Chechnya is both fragile and indirect, and its grip on the other republics is far from solid.</p> <p>The Georgian operation may well have been intended, in part, to impress Moscow's readiness to act if need be. Finally, in their hankering after a world in which they are coequal with the United States, the Russians seem to have assumed they had the potential to be the leader of a bloc of nations opposed to US policies, but the aftermath of Georgia shows the reverse to be the case.</p> <p>Western policy has not been designed to avoid exacerbating Russian neuroses. We have brought out the worst in them. The point that people like Kissinger and Shultz are making is important. If we want a more coherent and realistic Russia, we had better start being more coherent and realistic ourselves.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Pierre Laval has declined to attend any further sittings of his own trial [for treason as Vichy prime minister]. His lawyers have also withdrawn in protest. The trial is now proceeding without the accused and without defence.</p> <p>Scenes which can only be described as scandalous led to this state of affairs on Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>The Procurator General repeated all the arguments he had already offered twice - namely Laval was being tried for public acts of which the evidence was the laws promulgated over his signature ('If I signed them you executed them,' retorted Laval, apostrophising the French magistracy in general) and broadcast speeches the text of which is not disputed.</p> <p>Laval claimed the right to answer the Procurator; in particular, to state that the charges brought against him were untrue. The Judge denied him this right. Meanwhile the assessors were showing themselves angrily impatient. The Judge was obviously losing control of himself, shouting at Laval to be silent when for once he was already silent.</p> <p>But the Judge was not to be stopped on the path of self-abasement. \"Do you,\" he asked, \"think yourself assured of impunity?\" \"No,\" said Laval, \"but there is something above us all, above you, above me. It is truth and justice, of which you ought to be the expression.\"</p> <p>At this point the assessors began to join in more loudly and words such as \"Provocateur,\" \"You'll get your twelve bullets.\" \"You'll talk less a fortnight hence,\" began to fly.</p> <p>\"The High Court will have the last word,\" cried the Judge. \"Do you refuse to reply?\" \"I do,\" said Laval, who had not up to this moment committed himself to this attitude. \"Reflect,\" said the Judge. \"Yes,\" said Laval, his dark face darkened with passion. \"Yes, in view of your aggression and of the manner in which you interrogated me. You formulate both question and answer.\"</p> <p>After a long suspension the Court resumed its sitting. Laval replied: \"I have a declaration to make. The insulting manner in which you interrogated me just now shows me that I may be the victim of a judicial crime. I do not wish to be its accomplice. I prefer to be silent.\" Laval was led out and the Judge called for the first witness.</p> <p>His absence from his own trial has serious consequences. The verdict finally loses most of its authority. Laval is a very isolated and bitterly hated man to-day.

  "<p>The Football Association chairman, David Triesman, yesterday threatened to enforce a salary cap on England's leading clubs as part of a wide-ranging and often damning address on the game's finances.</p> <p>Setting out the FA's plans to become a stricter regulator for football and placing himself on a collision course with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>, Lord Triesman attacked an industry that he said had run up \u00a33bn of debt, speaking of the \"very tangible dangers\" for the game at a time of much uncertainty in global finance. </p> <p>\"In the current climate it could be that we have to work out [wage] restraints and what they might be,\" he said during a speech to the Leaders in Football conference at Stamford Bridge. \"A sensible form of [wage] restraint would make sense and it is not inconceivable. It's very hard to do anything unless all parties want to do it and everyone needs to want to do it. Preferably without being compelled.\"</p> <p>Triesman's proposals will put the FA squarely at odds with the Premier League, particularly his ambitions for the governing body to become the English game's regulator. Senior government figures have this week been explicit that the FA's powers should be extended, and Uefa, the European governing body, is certain to offer support, having itself lobbied the European Commission to become football's statutory regulator.</p> <p>Triesman set out an ambitious manifesto for reform of the game's regulatory structure. \"I think we are too fragmented with too many bodies responsible for too many parts of the sport,\" he said. \"Greater clarity is needed about who is responsible for the fitness and future of the game. A clear sports law could clarify the position. The time has come for a comprehensive sports law apportioning responsibility and accountability.\" </p> <p>He also called for a strengthening of the fit-and-proper-persons test for club owners to include considerations of human-rights abuses alongside a prospective buyer's financial history. But most of his speech was given over to the volatility of the credit markets and its impact on English clubs. Triesman was referring to Manchester United when he talked of the \"impenetrable instruments\" of debt clubs have accrued. He said clubs must \"decrease their indebtedness\" by refinancing - although market conditions forbid most that luxury - or paying it down.</p> <p>In response the Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, compared Triesman's aversion to debt with that of the Uefa president, Michel Platini, who Scudamore claimed \"thinks all debt is bad\". Scudamore instead believes that borrowings are sustainable if they are in keeping with revenues. Despite the biggest anomaly of Manchester United, whose debts are \u00a3666m, he pointed out that the ratio of debt to earnings at Premier League clubs is broadly 1.1:1.</p> <p>But Scudamore was most strident in responding to Triesman's regulatory ambitions, insisting that the league should not yield to the whims of an organisation that is in some ways its commercial rival. \"We are like competitors,\" he said. \"We compete for sponsorship and for television rights and we are in the same space. </p> <p>\"The way it works here is tripartite. The Football League with its long reach, the Premier League with its different focus and different appeal and the FA all working together. If we draw three circles the overlap doesn't need to be huge.\"</p> <h2>FA ponders appeal</h2> <p>The FA may appeal against the paltry \u20ac14,000 fine Fifa handed Croatia last month. David Triesman will discuss it with Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, after the racist abuse England's Emile Heskey suffered in Zagreb. Lord Triesman said: \"We want to make sure that in the international system racist abuse is dealt with effectively.\"</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister was forced to rush forward his plans for recapitalisation of the banks after the markets, and debilitating leaks, had left the government's timetable in tatters. </p> <p>As banks shares nosedived yesterday, Downing Street had to act, suddenly announcing that Gordon Brown would meet the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, yesterday evening. No 10, desperate to convey the impression it was not being driven by events, insisted the meeting was part of a series, and had been in the diary for a while - even though no mention of it had been made at the prime minister's morning briefing. </p> <p>It was a setback for Brown, who has been hoping for a new lease of political life by his stewardship of the banking crisis.</p> <p>Instead of exuding authority, as he did last week with the appointment of the national economic council, the government has been playing catch-up - uncertain how to react to events unfolding before its eyes but out of its control.</p> <p>Instead of being on top of events and acting decisively, the chancellor has been criticised for dithering. Yesterday, he was forced to rush back from a meeting of European finance ministers in Luxembourg for talks at No 10. By then, experts were demanding and expecting immediate government action. </p> <p>\"We believe that governments need to do more and will be forced to do so,\" said UBS economist Stephane Deo. </p> <p>The meeting came after two days in which events, leaks and market meltdown had made the government look weak. Privately the Treasury and No 10 attempted to point the finger at the Conservatives - and, more remarkably, at the bankers themselves - for destabilising the City. Both were alleged to be leaking plans and meetings before the government had things in place to unveil its own solutions, thereby causing panic on the stock exchange, which in turn led ministers to have to reconsider their options hurriedly. </p> <p>During a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night, the prime minister blamed the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, and the Conservative leader, David Cameron, for talking up what were the government's developing plans to recapitalise the ailing banks. Labour believes Osborne and Cameron may have got wind of the Treasury's proposal when they met with King on Friday. It may even be possible that King wanted the Tories to push the proposal. </p> <p>Critics say the Tories flagged up the scheme over the weekend to make it appear that they were ahead of ministers - a charge flatly denied by the Conservatives. </p> <p>Whatever the truth, the Treasury was fuming on Monday morning because there was an expectation in the morning papers that Darling was poised to unveil a rescue package later that day. He was not. </p> <p>Officials had tried to rein in the speculation on Sunday night, briefing hard that Darling would, as yet, have nothing to say on recapitalisation when he made his Commons statement to MPs on Monday afternoon. They stressed that he had other immediate priorities, including an IMF meeting in Washington and the Mais lecture today, on the government's borrowing rules.</p> <p>But the briefing didn't work. </p> <p>As Darling laboured through his statement, shares in London tumbled even further. He insisted that he would take his time in announcing any package: \"We saw from what happened in the US that nothing is worse than coming forward with a plan that is not sufficiently developed and about which questions cannot be answered.\" He added that this had resulted in trillions being lost over the following 10 days.</p> <p>After his Commons statement Darling, at his own request, met a group of senior bankers in the presence of King and the Financial Services Authority chairman, Lord Turner. The Treasury did not put forward any specific plan, and intended to keep this meeting private, but details emerged from banking sources.</p> <p>In his morning blog yesterday, Robert Peston, the BBC business correspondent, claimed that at the meeting \"a gang of three of Barclays, RBS and Lloyds TSB told Darling to pull his finger out and finalise whatever it is he's eventually prepared to offer on taxpayers' behalf\". </p> <p>As bank share prices duly tumbled in morning trading, Peston was accused by the banks, Treasury officials and even some contributors on his blog of either hyping the import of the bankers' meeting, so spooking the markets; or, alternatively, acting irresponsibly by reporting genuinely sensitive information. </p> <p>For a second time in two days, the government had been bounced into responding to a story about its still incomplete plan to take an equity stake in ailing banks. </p> <p>The effect yesterday morning was to force the prime minister's spokesman to press the mute button at his morning briefing, save to promise that the government was aware of the urgency.</p> <p>Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, was the first to claim that the government simply did not have the luxury of time in which to produce a perfect scheme. \"The continuing uncertainty over the government's intentions is proving very damaging,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We are in a fast-moving world where there are lots of leaks and information, and stories coming out of the government [are] that recapitalisation is what they are planning. </p> <p>\"I fear it is contributing to a climate of uncertainty with people not sure exactly what the government is going to do, so it will probably will have to come forward with proposals earlier than it feels comfortable with. </p> <p>Continued uncertainty will only force more banks to the wall. It is much more sensible to deal with this proactively, rather than through a succession of collapses like those of Bradford &amp; Bingley or Northern Rock.\"</p> <p>By mid-afternoon yesterday, the government let it be known that meetings were taking place with Brown, Darling, Brown and Turner - a sure sign that a package of some form was being cobbled by the government and the Bank together ready for today's markets.</p>",
  "<p>By day, Len \"Smithie\" Smith was to be found hunkered down in a shell hole in no man's land with his trusty pad and pencil. Or perhaps poking his head out of a British trench, risking a bullet from a German sniper to make a quick sketch. Later, in a candlelit cellar, he would painstakingly produce detailed images that were designed to help the top brass plan their war strategy, but would not have looked out of place as works of art on a general's drawing room wall. </p> <p>The remarkable story of Smithie, who drew and fought in northern France in the first world war, is being told for the first time after his diary, complete with hundreds of vivid illustrations, was published yesterday. </p> <p>Smith's journal recalls daring missions, such as when he produced a detailed sketch of an oak tree just six metres from enemy lines so engineers could produce an exact copy - with a built-in observation post - that was swapped for the real thing. </p> <p>But it also describes more ordinary but moving tasks he was commissioned to undertake, including painting the names of fallen comrades on simple wooden crosses or scrubbing out German street names in northern France and replacing them with the French originals. The most remarkable aspect is that even in the heat of battle he produced work that was not merely functional but beautiful.</p> <p>Before the war, Smith, from Walthamstow in east London, had a fledgling career as a commercial artist and enjoyed some success designing a poster advertising Crosse and Blackwell jam. At the age of 22 he enlisted as an infantryman. He hid his notebook and pencils in his leggings and kept an illustrated diary. </p> <p>Smith started off sketching his friends. He drew his pal Sam reading the letter informing him his son had been born. He sketched caricatures of friends after the regimental barber had shorn their hair. And he made less sympathetic drawings of those he did not take to - such as an officer nicknamed \"Murphy the Menace\".</p> <p>Smith also produced images of British and German equipment. On one page a rudimentary British grenade - explosive packed into an old jam tin - is juxtaposed with the much more professional German equivalent. </p> <p>He lovingly drew pictures of steaming pots of Irish stew, baguettes strapped to a backpack, a friendly black pig he came across. Smith also records an extraordinary episode when British and German soldiers organised an unofficial truce. They exchanged gifts and had a snowball fight - until one \"bright villain\" thought to hide a bomb in a snowball. </p> <p>Calmly and accurately, Smith wrote of the horror of war. Of one bombardment he wrote: \"The sky seems a mass of flames - the air is drenched with fumes and smoke and all is chaos.\" But even these pages are lovely to look at, shot through with images of fire and explosions. On another page a missile whizzing through the night sky looks more like a shooting star, and to his artist's eye even mortars were \"huge toffee apples sailing out rather slowly\". </p> <p>Smith's skill with the rifle and the pencil were noticed after a year and he was made a sniper and an observer. Delighted at no longer having to hide his pencils and paper, Smith spent whole days hidden away in no man's land making sketches and taking notes until the evening mist fell and he could crawl back home. </p> <p>In 1916 Smith was ordered to make a detailed sketch of the German lines at Vimy ridge in northern France. Despite constant shelling from the Germans he produced a two-metre-long image of the enemy's position. </p> <p>\"I had to scramble all over the shop making rough pencil notes,\" he wrote. \"Real risky work.\" The brigadier-general was clearly impressed with the work's artistic merits as well as the strategic benefit. Smith recalls that he declared it \"very cleverly executed ... but above all infinitely useful\".</p> <p>After a bout of trench fever Smith was transferred to the special branch works park, where his talents were used to help camouflage troops and equipment. </p> <p>One job was to camouflage guns. He would draw patterns on them and, just like a child's paint-by-numbers kit, mark the different areas with a figure corresponding to a colour so the gunners could finish the job off themselves.</p> <p>But his most startling job involved sketching an oak tree stump that stood within the barbed wire six metres from German trenches. Engineers then produced a copy of the tree in iron and steel, complete with ladder running up through the hollow centre. \"Scene shifters\" removed the real tree and replaced it with the fake one by night, \"praying that Jerry will not tumble the game\". They didn't and, amazingly, a man was able to scramble through tunnels to the tree and observe what the enemy was up to. </p> <p>War ended, and Smith's final sketch is of a one-way ticket back home that reads: \"Blighty route. Single to England-home-beauty.\"</p> <p>After he returned, Smith had a successful career as a commercial artist. He never spoke about the war but tried unsuccessfully to get his diary published. He died in December 1974 at Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, at the age of 83, believing his diary would languish for ever in a cupboard. </p> <p>But his great-nephew, Dave Mason, has finally published it by putting the collection online at greatwarartist.com.</p>",
  "<p>They were not exactly queuing outside the banks in downtown Reykjavik yesterday, but news that a second of the island outpost's three big banks had been taken under government control was beginning to rattle more than a few.</p> <p>\"This whole situation is beginning to look very very nasty,\" said Pall Gudnarson, 44, hurrying along a rainswept pavement near the main shopping street, Laugarvegur. \"It's certainly going to affect me personally. I don't think there's any way of avoiding it now. It's making me angry.\"</p> <p>Gudnarson said he had recently opened a small business - a solarium - and, having seen the value of his shareholdings in a number of Icelandic financial institutions plummet, had to take out a sizeable loan.</p> <p>\"Inflation is through the roof and my repayments are getting harder and harder to meet,\" he said. \"I'm just about hanging on, but there will be many in my position. Plus, most of my remaining money is in Kaupthing, the one big bank left standing. If that goes under, I can't see how I won't lose everything.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, most Icelanders - Gudnarson included - seem confident their country will weather the storm. \"I've been working since I was 18,\" he said, \"and this would be the third time the banks and the government between them have managed to make my work worthless. We always come back. Iceland has strong fundamentals. We're not going to fall into the North Sea.\"</p> <p>Locals proudly cite the strength and profitability of Iceland's core fishing industry, its more or less limitless supply of cheap geothermal energy, a first-class education and healthcare system as reasons the country will, eventually, pull through. \"But we will really have to pull back into ourselves,\" said Gudnarson. \"This mad foreign adventure, buying up companies all round the world, is over. We've been badly burned.\" </p> <p>Palme Vidar, a 73-year-old retired fisherman, has also seen it all before. \"They're talking about Russia bailing us out. I remember in the 60s, they saved us then too - oil for fish, it was. Except they gave us a lot of terrible Russian cars, too. Then in 82, when the herring disappeared. That was bad, the krona fell 35% then too. But we recovered.\"</p> <p>At the wheel of his ageing Toyota, Vidar blamed \"those aggressive young entrepreneurs\" and the \"greedy bankers\" for Iceland's predicament. \"Money was cheap, and the banks didn't stop to think about the risks of what they were doing,\" he said. \"They have debts that are 10 or 12 times what this country can produce in a year. That's madness.\"</p> <p>He was not worried for himself. \"My house is paid for long ago, I have my pension.

  "<p>Funnily enough, I'm not really into car movies. When I come home after a week's rallying, I don't even want to talk about driving - it's my day job, and sometimes you've got to chill. So I found Death Race a bit lacklustre. It starts out well, with a mysterious murder, but as soon as the racing begins the film turns into a sadistic, live-action version of Mario Kart.</p> <p>Jason Statham plays a wrongly convicted racing driver who has to earn his freedom by taking part in a televised, anything-goes road race. The driving was, surprisingly, quite realistic. Almost everything they did with the cars was plausible. They were bashing into each other and grinding against barriers, but the physics behind those crashes looked pretty accurate.</p> <p>There were one or two occasions when the film-makers overstepped the mark. For instance, reversing your car in mid-race to drive backwards and shoot at another driver with your bonnet-mounted machine guns . . . that probably wouldn't work very well. It's not actually impossible, but you would have trouble keeping up your speed in reverse gear. The amount of armour and bulletproof glass bolted on to those cars would slow them down a lot anyway, and there is no way they were put together in a prison auto shop. That's highly skilled engineering.</p> <p>How would I do in Death Race? I'd like to think I'd win - I certainly wouldn't want to die. If I was ever forced into that situation, my competitive spirit would make me fight tooth and nail, even to the death. I'd have to create a different driving style, though. The trouble with Death Race is that when you get out in front, you just become a sitting duck for the guy behind you with a giant machine gun. </p> <p>\u2022 Guy Wilks is the 2007 British Rally champion. <strong>Death Race </strong>is on general release.</p>",
  "<p>What is merely a nuisance for most people - a car breakdown, for example - can be a nightmare for carers not knowing what will happen to their loved one if they can't get home.</p> <p>Bee Stronach is the carer for her husband, Geoff, who suffers from vascular dementia and needs 24-hour care. Without children or any other family member living near to them in Rotherham, when Bee heard about plans for a carers' emergency scheme she immediately asked to be included. \"It had got to the stage where I was frightened about going out and particularly careful about driving anywhere,\" she says. \"It was always playing on my mind about what would happen to Geoff if I had an accident.\" </p> <p>Bee was one of the first to be registered with Rotherham council's scheme, which is a service for carers who are concerned about what may happen to the person they care for should an emergency arise. A discussion and assessment takes place with all concerned for a plan to be put in place. </p> <p>\"The plan includes the names of two people, friends, relatives or neighbours who are prepared to assist in providing care in an emergency,\" explains Lisa Thistlewood, Rotherham's carers' emergency assessment officer. If no one is available and the person concerned is in receipt of, or eligible for, social services care, the scheme will provide support from a local care attendant service for up to a maximum of 72 hours, free of charge. </p> <p>Following the assessment, the carer is issued with a keyring, an identity card and mobile phone sticker alerting others that they are a carer and a member of the scheme. There is also an emergency social care telephone number and the carer's unique reference number. \"What was brilliant was the speed with which it was all put in place,\" says Roger Smith who lives in Warwickshire but has elderly parents hundreds of miles away in Rotherham. \"I've since been rung a couple of times to check that everything's OK.\" </p> <p>It was fortuitous for Smith that his parents live in Rotherham, where the emergency scheme has been highlighted by the government inspectorate as an example of good practice. It was established last December as a result of the government's 2006 white paper Our Health, Our Care, Our Say, and its subsequent New Deal for Carers, with \u00a325m allocated to local authorities to fund schemes in their areas. </p> <p>Demand for the actual implementation of emergency plans to be triggered is expected to be low, but the value in terms of peace of mind for carers is high.</p>",
  "<h2>A bridge too far</h2> <p>London's mayor has a tough decision to take on the proposed motorway-scale Thames Gateway bridge. Either he pushes ahead with this \u00a3500m gorilla - which a public inquiry showed conclusively would bring congestion and pollution, but little regeneration, to east London - or he plucks up courage and overrides the road-building instincts of the big business community. Last week, he sounded like he had remembered his manifesto pledge to scrap plans for the bridge. Having been heckled by some of his strongest critics at a Transport for London board meeting, he adjourned the debate, invited one of them to have her say, and then said: \"Come back to the next meeting. I think you'll find that matters on that front are evolving.\" </p> <h2>Reclaim the beach</h2> <p>Landowners lucky enough to have lengths of coastline on their land are steaming that they will not be allowed to appeal against people being allowed to walk over it, under the new right of public coastal access, and will get no compensation if they lose out financially. \"It is absurd, unjust and unfair that the government has rejected an independent right of appeal,\" wails Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, chair of the Country Land and Business Association. But others would say it is \"absurd, unjust and unfair\" that people can't appreciate some of Britain's most beautiful land. </p> <h2>Woman of the week</h2> <p>Prize for the most impressive woman in Britain this week could go to Anita Rivas, an inspirational Ecuadorean who was in London to see the government and fight for the preservation of the extraordinarily rich Yasun\u00ed national park. This Amazonian treasure should be protected, but Argentine, French and local oil companies have started drilling, and a worldwide campign against them has started. \"If we keep the oil below the ground, not only will we conserve an enormously diverse area, home to many indigenous people, but also we will become a universal symbol that a new world is possible,\" said Anita. Shame that the new Department of Energy and Climate Change could not find time to see her.</p> <h2>Too much hot air</h2> <p>Philip \"Dotty Stotty\" Stott, emeritus professor of geography at London University, has been quiet of late, but Eco Soundings' favourite climate change sceptic has come up with a list of new ministers who will be needed in the new climate change department. \"Minister for cosmic ray fluxes, solar magnetic cycles, and sunspots; minister for meteorites and cosmic dust; minister of state for the Earth's orbit, tilt, wobble, shape, and rotational velocity; minister of state for water vapour, clouds, and atmospheric gases; and parliamentary under secretary of state for carbon dioxide and methane, both natural and anthropogenic.\" And how about a minister to control contrarian gibberish? </p> <h2>Bypass blues</h2> <p>A bypass round Alderley Edge has been proposed for more than 25 years, but for the last decade it's been assumed that the small Cheshire town would not get one. This is because it is in the constituency of George Osborne, the Tory shadow chancellor, and when has a Labour administration ever wanted to chuck money at one of the truest and bluest of all England's constituencies? But perhaps the three-mile road is actually designed to make Mr Osborne look like a spendthrift who does not understand the environment. According to the Department for Transport, the single-lane road he has been lobbying for will cost \u00a317m a mile and will expose at least 250 homes to more noise.</p>",
  "<p>About 160,000 teenagers over the age of 15 have recently been beaten by parents trying to assert discipline, research for the children's charity NSPCC revealed last night. It released the results of a survey on the eve of a Commons vote on whether Britain should join the 19 other European countries that have banned corporal punishment in the family. The NSPCC said a poll of more than 1,900 parents showed one in eight children of all ages had been smacked during the past six months.</p> <p>The charity was surprised to find how much physical punishment persisted into the mid-teens. About 7% of young people aged 15-17 had been hit by a parent in the last six months. Dame Mary Marsh, the charity's chief executive, said: \"Parents who are hitting teenagers are likely to have been smacking their children since they were small, so it clearly isn't working.\"</p> <p>The Commons will today debate a cross-party amendment at the report stage of the children and young persons bill which would give children the same protection against physical assault as adults.</p> <p>Legislation in 2004 allowed parents to hit their children as long as they do not leave a bruise, graze or red mark.</p> <p>More than 100 Labour backbenchers signed a private statement urging ministers to allow a free vote. </p> <p>Last week the UN committee on the rights of the child criticised the government for failing to prohibit corporal punishment in the family.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps it was the shock which Polly Toynbee claims to have felt at Gordon Brown's decision to bring back Peter Mandelson which provoked - even for her - an unusually virulent attack on New Labour (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/04/gordonbrown.mandelson\">This 1997 tribute band is out of tune with our times</a>, October 4).</p> <p>In it, she laid into Progress, the New Labour pressure group of which I am director. Her ire at all things Mandelsonian was no doubt stoked by the fact that, as she correctly notes, the new business secretary helped found Progress over a decade ago, and his former aide, Derek Draper, was our first director. But she mischaracterises the New Labour agenda.</p> <p>Toynbee's central allegation is that the prime minister's reshuffle fails to offer Labour a \"renewed sense of political direction or purpose\", and she appears to claim that Progress bears some responsibility for this. \"Fresh thinkers are needed,\" she writes, \"not the stuckists of more than a decade ago steeped in market idolatry.\" Progress is thus accused of calling for \"more outdated government-shrinking 'reform', privatisings, co-payments and outsourcings at a time when the importance of government has never been more evident\".</p> <p>Progress wants to see a greater devolution of power to both individual public service users and local communities through new forms of public ownership such as community-run mutual organisations; to characterise this as \"privatisation\" is fundamentally misguided. And the broader agenda Toynbee ascribes to Progress is simply not one I recognise.</p> <p>Progress policy groups - including that on public services chaired by the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, whom Toynbee also singles out for attack - have this summer floated ideas ranging from giving parents of children in failing schools greater rights to choose an alternative school, to giving a tax-free year to those returning to work after a long period on benefits. </p> <p>Each of our proposals is aimed at tackling the deep inequities in British society about which Toynbee frequently writes so powerfully. We've also been suggesting such shockingly reactionary measures as placing prisons under a new duty to reduce reoffending rates (with those that fail to be put under new, locally accountable control), and providing parents with a new childcare credit, weighted to give more to low-income families.</p> <p>Toynbee's other main line of attack against Progress - the suggestion that we \"keep nostalgically rewriting 1997\" and \"conveniently forget that the 1997 manifesto was more radical than anything Labour dares do now\" - is perhaps even more misplaced. Before nostalgia gets the better of her, let's not forget that the middle England-reassuring manifesto of 1997 also included the pledge not to raise the basic and upper rates of income tax; the promise to stick to Tory spending plans for the first two years in government; and measures to fast-track the prosecution of young offenders and impose new \"something for something\" conditions as part of the welfare-to-work New Deal. None of which, I'd guess, set Toynbee's heart racing at the time.</p> <p>Toynbee is entitled to find the reshuffle akin to \"a 1997 tribute band, out of tune with these transformed times\". But in her depiction of New Labour, she's the one who's beginning to sound like a broken record.</p> <p>\u2022 Robert Philpot is the director of Progress <br><a href=\"mailto:office@progressives.org.uk\">office@progressives.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>MPs and peers returned to Westminster this week to confirm what Labour MPs hoped and Conservative colleagues feared on the party conference circuit last month: that the economic crisis has changed politics once again. As Ruth Kelly put it in an exit interview: \"Gordon has regained the permission of the electorate to be heard again.\" Tory MPs agree.</p> <p>That does not give him carte blanche to throw his weight around. Far from it. At Monday night's first meeting of the Parliamentary Labour party (PLP), so many present report, July's dispirited mood had given way to renewed hope and a sense of unity of purpose. One likely casualty of that mood will be the prime minister's commitment to increasing pre-charge detention limits from 28 to 42 days. It is set out in the latest counter-terrorism bill.</p> <p>No 10 is not yet saying Gordon Brown is throwing in a towel in which he has invested a lot of political capital since succeeding Tony (defeated over 90 days) Blair. But many who wish him well confidently believe that will happen when (not if?) a cross-party vote in the Lords, no longer the reactionary bastion of old, rejects the proposal on Monday night. </p> <p>Normally that would result in end-of-session ping-pong between both houses. But times are no longer normal. David Cameron and George Osborne realise the electorate now regards the global crisis as sufficiently serious to make routine party skirmishing a luxury. Resourceful though they are, they must now engage in \"me-too-ism\", never much fun for an opposition.</p> <p>On 42 days, Brown's problem is with his own party. On Monday night Barry Sheerman called on ministers to concentrate on the economy and avoid divisive issues. Patricia Hewitt specifically raised 42 days, though she voted for it reluctantly when it scraped through the Commons by nine votes in June. </p> <p>Critics say Brown should use a Lords defeat as an excuse to concede the consensus he expected has failed to materialise after a host of police chiefs, law chiefs, prosecutors and spies joined civil libertarians in saying it was not needed. Revised procedures - including lower charging thresholds and post-charge questioning - give the retreat respectable underpinning. But unity is the key.</p> <p>It will not stop there. More than 100 Labour MPs have declared in favour of a total ban on smacking, even by parents, but Nick Brown, the retread new chief whip, will not allow them a free vote on such a divisive issue in tonight's vote on the children and young persons bill. MPs campaigning to use the human fertilisation and embryology bill to liberalise abortion laws will also get short shrift.</p> <p>By the same token, MPs expect Alistair Darling to use his pre-budget report to drop his high-minded attempt to tax older, dirtier cars off the road. If the Lords amends the planning bill to ensure an accountable minister, not an unelected planning board, makes final decisions on power station sites and even airport runways, ministers may have to bow.</p> <p>It may not be a government of national unity yet, but all sides are pulling punches.</p>",
  "<p>You might suppose that the economic tornado hitting Britain would cause the government to focus its energy and resources very tightly on the political projects that are of undoubted value. This is not, after all, the moment to be wasting either political or financial capital. But you would be wrong. Faced with a crisis that it patently can't control, the government is instead seeking to exert power where it still can: over us. </p> <p>The state's latest plan to watch us makes every other imminent intrusion seem limited. Next month's Queen's speech will contain a brief reference to an innocuous-sounding communications data bill. But what this means is the development of a centralised database that will track, in real time, every call we make, every website we visit, and every text and email we send. That information will then be stored and analysed - perhaps for decades. It will mean the end of privacy as we know it. </p> <p>In the name of the fight against crime, and the fight against terror, we are all to be monitored as if we could be suspects. Computers will analyse our behaviour for signs of deviance. The minute we become of interest to anyone in authority - perhaps because we take part in a demonstration, have an argument with a security guard at an airport, spend too long on a website, or are witness to a crime - the police or the security services will be able to dip into our records and construct a near-complete pattern of our lives. </p> <p>The shocking element to the new plan is that the authorities want their own database only because they find the current limitations frustrating. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act rules, the 700 or so bodies already licensed to watch us must make a certified request to phone or internet firms for individual records. More than 500,000 such requests were made last year. But the companies are reluctant to hang on to the data, and the security services would find a single, accessible database so much more convenient. </p> <p>Stop and consider this for a moment. Think about how happy any of us would be to have our lives laid out to official view. All our weaknesses, our private fears and interests, would be exposed. Our web searches are guides to what is going on in our minds. A married man might spend a lot of time on porn websites; a successful manager might be researching depression; a businessman might be looking up bankruptcy law. </p> <p>We all have a gulf between who we really are and the face we present to the world. Suddenly that barrier will be taken away. Would a protester at the Kingsnorth power station feel quite so confident in facing the police if she knew that the minute she was arrested, the police could find out that she'd just spent a week looking at abortion on the web? Would a rebel politician stand up against the prime minister if he knew security services had access to the 100 text messages a week he exchanged with a woman who wasn't his wife? It isn't just the certainty that such data would be used against people that is a deterrent, it's the fear. As the realisation of this power grew, we would gradually start living in the prison of our minds. </p> <p>This is only the worst manifestation of an official intrusion into our lives that is just about to hit us, but of which we seem strangely unaware. The UK's network of speed cameras will soon be able to track every journey we make by road under the automated number-plate recognition system. Mobile network records can already place us, at any time, within 100 yards of our phone's location. The ID database will record every time we go to a hospital or a benefit centre, fill in a prescription or a draw a large sum from a bank. The children's database will give access to every piece of gossip or fact about our children or their family, perhaps in perpetuity. It will record that an older sister may be alcoholic, or that a father is in jail, or that a 14-year-old is thought to be having sex. Nobody will be able to break free of this information about their past. </p> <p>Most alarming of all, for its breadth of knowledge about us, the NHS database will give hundreds of thousands of staff the ability to discover when we lost our virginity, the drugs we're on, our mental health history. And none of this information will be safe, because we know three things about the mass collection of data. The first is that the authorities will mine it where it suits them. The second is that the data will be lost. And the third is that it will leak. </p> <p>Only last month a Revenue &amp; Customs worker was jailed for twice passing the address of a battered woman to her current boyfriend - the woman's husband. On each occasion, the battered woman and her children had to flee to a new address. That's the tip of an information iceberg. A couple of years ago the trial of journalists who had hacked into royal phones revealed the existence of a web of hackers, private detectives and dodgy policemen who could effectively gather all there was to be known about a person's private life. In a very few years there will be much more that could be known, and far fewer defences against it. </p> <p>The information commissioner, Richard Thomas, warns these changes must be debated because of the dangers that excessive surveillance poses to our way of life. Liberty's Shami Chakrabarti says the latest proposals are \"seismic\", and that they will \"transform the relationship between the individual and the state\". I'm all for the targeted pursuit of crime and terror, but this isn't it. This is a multibillion-pound misuse of the state's time and our money which will fundamentally damage our freedom to think and to act. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jenni.russell@theguardian.com\">jenni.russell@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Last night's meeting of Gordon Brown, his chancellor, Alistair Darling, and their finance advisers was, to put it mildly, overdue. The outcome was further delayed until an announcement today. Anything less than an absolute guarantee of the nation's bank deposits, already in place in Ireland and Germany, is now unthinkable.</p> <p>Darling's statement to parliament on Monday beggared belief. The financial equivalent of al-Qaida had penetrated the nation's defences and placed explosive devices in every financial institution in the land. The threat to the economy was unprecedented and immediate. Yet all Darling could offer was to do \"whatever is necessary to maintain stability\" and say that it would be \"irresponsible to speculate on specifics\". </p> <p>He mentioned no new cash to the money markets, no guarantees for personal or corporate deposits, no Europe-wide action and no bail-out for the banks. Indeed he said nothing, except to imply distaste for the emergency measures already being taken by foreign governments. He thus indicated that he would not join them.</p> <p>Nothing could have been more damaging to confidence than this non-statement. Darling wiped a mind-boggling \u00a3100bn off the value of the top 100 British companies, the biggest one-day fall in history, offering every economics student a vignette of regulatory ineptitude. If Darling's resignation were not the last thing Britain needs just now, he should offer it.</p> <p>Nor was the Bank of England any closer to reality. For months, its maverick monetary policy committee member, David Blanchflower, has been screaming for lower interest rates to aid company liquidity and avert recession. Yet the Bank remains inert, mesmerised by its (and the Treasury's) fixation with inflation. Worrying about inflation at present is like weeding the lawn when the house is on fire.</p> <p>When people lose confidence in banks, they put their money under the bed or send it to a better-ruled nation such as the Republic of Ireland. This does not spell the death of capitalism, as gleeful leftwingers claim. It shows what happens when unregulated capitalism overheats and suffers transmission failure. With the engine in neutral, confidence loses all traction.</p> <p>The only source of new credit is the government, backed by the future flow of taxes. Her Majesty's Government must become, for however brief a time, a bank. The need for that outcome is now glaringly obvious.</p> <p>Yet by nationalising only two banks, Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, Darling has effectively undermined the others. If he now buys their shares cheap, he must be guilty of \"shorting\" them.</p> <p>For the government to become a bank it must not merely muse on the idea and discuss \"doing whatevers\" and \"pondering options\". It must get on with it. Whether this takes the form of indemnifying bank deposits, insuring interbank lending or buying bank shares - or all of these - does not matter. Absolute financial security must be underwritten.</p> <p>What makes Darling's dithering all the more extraordinary is that he and the Bank of England must have prepared for this for weeks. Yet their staff apparently told bemused emissaries of the big banks on Monday night that they were \"still working on a plan\".</p> <p>Darling has implied, over and again, that he will do the same as his Irish and German counterparts when they faced a bank collapse. He has parroted that he will do \"whatever is necessary to ensure stability\". Yet he will not say what this is, and indeed he objects to the actions of the Irish and Germans. The impression is of a man who simply does not know what to do, like Lord Lamont in the sterling crisis of 1993.</p> <p>The longer that deposit security is delayed, the more markets will withdraw cash and speculate against bank shares. It is not irresponsibility or panic that has led tens of thousands of Britons to move their balances out of the domestic system. They may be overreacting, but the chancellor has encouraged them to do so. Would you gamble your savings on Darling's decisiveness, or on that of the present governor of the Bank or England?</p> <p>The stupefying sums of money allegedly required to restore market confidence are not real. The indebtedness of banks is underpinned by real, albeit postponed, value in the economy. Assets \"recapitalised\", or nationalised, by the Treasury are sellable as the economy improves - as was British oil in the 1980s - and taxpayers should be able to benefit from the risks they have been expected to take. This will happen quicker when the Bank finally lowers rates and company liquidity is eased.</p> <p>When the historian Barbara Tuchman catalogued The March of Folly, she defined it as an act that was known to be folly at the time. Told-you-so may be odious, but the Treasury has been warned for years that its indulgence of cheap loans and smart trading practices was dangerous.</p> <p>Three weeks ago Darling was advised on all sides that in matters of confidence, over-bold intervention was preferable to too little too late. He and Brown have been taught a lesson in leadership by, of all people, the corporatist Europeans, people who have wisely circumvented last weekend's empty attempt at collective decisiveness.</p> <p>As for the House of Commons, where has it been? The date of its return to work is fixed by the grouse-shooting season. Its members and media acolytes have spent the autumn in a Neronian bicker over the survival of the prime minister, which was never in doubt, while the western financial system imploded.</p> <p>As the Commons roamed the moors, the US Congress negotiated, revised and passed an emergency banking bill inside a fortnight. A congressional committee is already investigating the Lehmans failure and is tearing Wall Street executives asunder. On Monday the Icelandic parliament, older even than Westminster, passed an emergency bill in hours.</p> <p>The banking bill may see the statute book sometime next year - Christmas and Easter holidays presumably permitting. As for investigating the behaviour of bankers and regulators, forget it. MPs nowadays delegate such unpleasantries to the press. They are too busy pleading for City directorships. Not since the 1970s has a British parliament seemed so useless and a nation's economy more at sea.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>While much of the attention in the US election focuses on the daily verbal clashes between John McCain and Barack Obama, a battle is being fought with as much intensity on the ground involving tens of thousands of lawyers and campaign staff.</p> <p>In courtrooms in Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Georgia, Michigan, Florida, Wisconsin and other states, lawyers representing Democrats and civil liberties groups are locked in fights with Republicans over who is allowed to vote.</p> <p>The Republicans say they are only trying to prevent voter fraud. The Democrats, burnt by what happened in Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004, say they are trying to ensure the Republicans do not steal the election by making it difficult for poor whites, African-Americans, the young and other potential Democratic voters to cast their ballots.</p> <p>If Obama is heading for a landslide as the polls suggest, the issue could be academic in terms of the final result. But if the poll gap narrows over the next few weeks it could be critical. An academic study of the 2000 vote estimated that 2 million people were not allowed to cast their ballots, more than those who lost their votes through the much-publicised faulty voting machines.</p> <p>Laughlin McDonald, who takes the lead on voting rights for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is at the forefront of the registration battles, said yesterday it was possible that registration challenges by Republicans could match or outstrip those in 2000 and 2004. The increased interest in the election because of Obama on the part of African-Americans and the young could result in the biggest turnout in US election history and also increase the scope for voter suppression.</p> <p>\"There always is a problem with voter registration but we are seeing more of it than in the past ... I can only say we've gotten more calls and are investigating more cases than before,\" McDonald, author of several books on voting rights, said.</p> <p>Unlike most of Europe, where the mechanics of voting is not in party hands, the US process is left to state governments, and the parties in power often exploit this advantage. Democrats claim that rules introduced since 2004 in Republican-run Georgia, Indiana and Florida require specific pieces of ID that are unnecessary given there is little recent history of double-voting. They say the changes are politically motivated, aimed at African-Americans, Latinos, the young and other groups that tend to vote Democrat.</p> <p>Indiana and Georgia are asking for driving licences that include photographs, but that could discriminate against people without cars. A recent study found that while 80% of Americans have cars, only 22% of African-Americans do.</p> <p>There is the prospect on election day, as a result of the heightened interest, of huge queues, and this could be exacerbated by Republican activists mounting challenges over IDs. Lengthy queues could dissuade some from staying to vote. In 2004 some people had to queue in African-American neighbourhoods for two to three hours in Ohio, a state that Bush won by a slim margin.</p> <p>There have been several successful legal challenges in Ohio this year, including one last month that overturned a 2006 law that required a piece of registered mail to be sent to every voter in the state. Mail was not forwarded and anyone whose name appeared on the list as mail returned could be challenged on voting day, a process known as cageing. If it had been allowed to stand an estimated 600,000 people would have been disenfranchised.</p> <p>Professor Daniel Tokaji, of Ohio State University's Moritz college of law, who specialises in election law and has been involved in legal actions in defence of voter rights, said: \"There is a major systemic problem in the US. The people running the election have a stake in the election. It is the quintessential problem. If you had to design a system from scratch, you would not do this.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There are occasional examples of suppression involving Republican-leaning voters but, in the main, it is Democratic-leaning voters that are targeted.\"</p> <p>After another successful challenge that Tokaji was involved in, voters in Ohio who wanted to vote early were allowed to register and vote on the same day. The state Republican party had gone to court to block same day registration and voting.</p> <p>In Wisconsin a judge is to rule on October 23 on a lawsuit filed in August by the Republican attorney general, John Byron Van Hollen, seeking to force ID checks on 240,000 to 1 million voters in the state.</p> <p>Last month in Florida the registration applications of more than 5,000 people were held up on identity grounds. Under Florida law the name on a driving licence has to perfectly match that on the government's databank of social security numbers and names. In fact there are many spelling mistakes and mismatches, particularly in the Latino community, who sometimes use shortened versions of their names on social security cards and revert to their longer family names for driving licences. Even minor differences can provoke challenges.</p> <p>In Florida's Orange County more than 50% of the 672 challenged registrations were Democrats and only 10% Republicans. The Republicans say the discrepancy is because of the much bigger Democratic registration drive this year.</p> <p>One of the big demographic groups being targeted in states across the US is university students, among whom Obama enjoys support over McCain of at least two to one. Given potential confusion over whether they vote in the state in which they study or are from originally, there is a danger many will find themselves purged from voter lists.</p>",
  "<p>Chancellor Alistair Darling is preparing an announcement before the stockmarket opens tomorrow morning, giving details of a plan to ease the banking crisis following high-level talks at Downing Street this evening.</p> <p>The talks, which ended around 6.30pm, had been given added urgency after a day in which shares in the banks suffered another mauling, with HBOS plunging 41.5% to close at 94p a share and Royal Bank of Scotland falling 39% to close at 90p.</p> <p>The chancellor met the prime minister, the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Adair Turner, at 5pm. </p> <p>In a brief statement after the close of the meeting, Darling said he had been working with other officials \"to put the banks on a longer term sound footing\".</p> <p>He also intends to address parliament tomorrow afternoon.</p> <p>Among other banks, Barclays closed more than 9% lower and Lloyds TSB shares were down nearly 13%, as the lack of a coordinated rescue plan for the sector alarmed the City. The FTSE 100 closed slightly higher, ending the session up 16 points at 4605.2.</p> <p>Last night, Britain's bank bosses had met with Darling to discuss a possible \u00a350bn injection of equity, which is likely to form the centrepiece of the bail-out plan.</p> <p>The talks centre on the idea of a part-nationalisation of the banking system through the injection of capital into the banks via preference shares, which take precedence over ordinary shares during a liquidation but do not give the holders any voting rights.</p> <p>John Varley, the chief executive of Barclays, insisted this morning that he had not sought any capital from the government. RBS later issued its own denial, telling the London stockmarket that \"contrary to press speculation, RBS did not make a request to government for capital\". </p> <p>HBOS has also denied it has asked for fresh funds while Lloyds TSB declined to comment.</p> <p>But it is clear that the bank executives are anxious for the government to press on with any plan to recapitalise the sector and attempt to restore confidence in the high-street banks.</p> <p>Darling disappointed investors when he did not make an announcement during his appearance in parliament yesterday and analysts have warned that the continued uncertainty is undermining the sector.</p> <p>\"Alistair Darling keeps saying that he won't take a rushed decision. But we need to see decisive action,\" said Manus Cranny of MF Global Spreads. \"We are at a crisis moment.\"</p> <p>The CBI piled the pressure on the government to provide a \"circuit-breaker\" to bring relief to the banking sector.</p> <p>\"There are three separate but related problems: a continued lack of liquidity in money markets, the erosion of bank capital resulting from the devaluation of their assets and the loss of confidence among depositors that their money is safe,\" said CBI deputy director-general, John Cridland.</p> <p>And veteran City commentator, David Buik from Cantor Index, said the markets were \"running scared\" after last night's talks were reported.</p> <p>He blamed the government for its handling of the crisis talks. \"I've never seen more disgraceful financial management,\" he said. \"All we've got now is speculation and fear. The market has collapsed.\"</p> <p>Darling has been working on a rescue plan behind the scenes, but in public has been reluctant to discuss his proposals in detail for fear of unsettling the markets. In a statement to the Commons on Monday, he said: \"It is right that we look at every aspect \u2013 liquidity, capital and regulation \u2013 with other countries and of course with the financial sector itself, but it would be irresponsible to speculate on the specifics of future responses.\"</p> <p>Following his meeting with bank chiefs last night, the chancellor was due to have another meeting with them this afternoon ahead of his meeting with the prime minister.</p> <p>Downing Street said that the meeting this afternoon involving Brown had been in the diary for some time. But it was not mentioned when parliamentary lobby journalists were briefed this morning about the prime minister's day.</p> <p>In a further sign of the turmoil sweeping the world's financial markets, the Icelandic government seized control of Landsbanki, the second largest bank in the country, as it sought to avert a financial meltdown. The Russian government also pumped $36bn into its banking sector.</p> <p><strong>Asian recovery</strong></p> <p>There was a late recovery in Asia thanks to a shock interest rate cut in Australia. Heavy selling pushed Japan's Nikkei index down by 5% to its lowest point since December 2003, before it later recovered to close 2.2% lower at 10155.9 points</p> <p>The federal bank of Australia astounded the markets by cutting interest rates by a full percentage point overnight, to 6%. Australia's central bank said it was relaxing its monetary policy in an effort to stop economic growth deteriorating as the mayhem in the financial markets continues. The move raised hopes of combined action by the world's central banks to try to stimulate the global economy.</p> <p>\"But if that is what the market is hanging its hat on, then it could be sorely disappointed,\" said Cranny.</p> <p>The Bank of England will set UK interest rates on Thursday and business groups are already demanding a half-point cut to 4.5%.</p> <p>European finance ministers met in Luxembourg today to discuss the crisis. Europe's failure to agree a coordinated rescue package for its banks was a major factor behind yesterday's sell-off, so there was pressure for progress - but the finance ministers disappointed by agreeing to lift bank deposit insurance to just \u20ac50,000, half of what some were looking for.</p> <p>\"Until such time as the banking sector is not totally reliant on central bank intervention and until trust is restored among the banks, there can be no measurable improvement in equity prices,\" warned Buik.</p>",
  "<p>With election day less than a month away, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> face off in the second of three presidential debates tonight, with voters watching to see which has a better grip on the steadily worsening global economic situation.</p> <p>The debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, comes a day after global stock markets faltered, despite the US congress's vote last week to inject $700bn into US credit markets, setting the stage for a conversation tonight over how best to right the economy.</p> <p>As bad economic news has continued to dominate the presidential race, Obama has soared in the polls. Voters say they trust the Democrat more than McCain to handle the financial mess, and tie the Republican candidate to the unpopular Bush administration. </p> <p>Tonight the onus falls on McCain to, at the very least, halt Obama's momentum, regain energy and reignite enthusiasm behind his campaign, which last week announced it was pulling out of the key swing state of Michigan and has lost ground in polling in many other swing states.</p> <p>The forum's loosely structured town hall format, in which the candidates will take questions from members of the audience and viewers sending questions online, could favour McCain, who thrives in more relaxed settings. </p> <p>But Obama, a former law professor at the University of Chicago, is himself a skilled debater, and honed his craft over 16 months of encounters with Hillary Clinton and other candidates during the Democratic primary season. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the husband of McCain running mate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> will answer questions in an abuse-of-power inquiry in Alaska, CNN reported. </p> <p>A state legislative committee subpoenaed him and several aides to Palin, the governor of Alaska, in its investigation into whether Palin fired the state's public safety commissioner to settle a personal score. </p> <p>The commissioner, Walt Monegan, had refused to sack a state trooper who was embroiled in a messy child custody dispute with Palin's sister. Palin dismissed him in July, stating publicly that the two had a disagreement on budget issues. The legislature's report on the matter is due on Friday.</p> <p>The last presidential debate was largely seen as a draw, with some commentators giving Obama a slight edge. The debate will be moderated by Tom Brokaw of NBC News.</p> <p>Polls have shown the economy is the foremost issue on voters' minds, and the crumbling stock markets, worsening employment and still-frozen credit markets have combined to make it the most salient issue of the race. </p> <p>Over the weekend, McCain aides said they would try to move the conversation away from economic issues and onto questions of character. </p> <p>Since then, Palin has questioned Obama's association with a 1960's-era radical, who participated in bombings but now is renowned in Chicago as an education policy expert. She also brought up his attendance at the church of Reverend Jeremiah Wright, a fiery, divisive preacher who provided fodder for Clinton's campaign. </p> <p>But the timing of the McCain camp's efforts, coming as Obama's poll numbers are gaining and the economy is flagging, may cause voters to consider them a distraction.</p> <p>In response, the Obama campaign unveiled a website and documentary-style video highlighting McCain's ties to Charles Keating, a banking executive who went to prison in connection with the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s. </p> <p>A Senate committee in 1991 exonerated McCain in the matter, but faulted his \"poor judgment\" in his dealings with Keating. The Obama campaign says the episode illustrates a lapse in judgment on matters of financial oversight.</p> <p>In a memo released this morning, Obama spokesman Bill Burton sought to downplay expectations of the Democrat's performance tonight, noting, \"When it comes to sheer format, we enter today's debate the decided underdog\". That is a common campaign tactic in the run up to debates. Burton also predicted McCain would sling mud at Obama rather than engage him on economic issues.</p> <p>\"In order to change the dynamics of this race, we anticipate that McCain will launch his nastiest attacks and continue to lie about Barack Obama's record and his vision to fundamentally change our country,\" he said. He continued: \"The American people aren't interested in nasty, false attacks, and they're not interested in four more years of Bush policies. But that's all he's offering.\"</p> <p>Tonight's questions are likely to focus on economic issues. Yesterday, the Dow Jones closed below 10,000 points for the first time since 2004, finishing several hundred points lower than the day George Bush took office in January 2001. </p> <p>That provides ammunition for Obama to press his case that the country is worse off after eight years of Republican control of the White House, and that McCain would only continue Bush's failed policies of tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.</p> <p>To the extent that McCain is forced to confront the economy tonight, he is likely to continue to press his case that an Obama administration would raise taxes, hindering job growth and economic recovery.</p> <p>Meanwhile, new rounds of polling continue to show voters moving steadily into Obama's camp. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released this morning has Obama ahead in the key swing state of Ohio, 51 percent to 45 percent. An aggregate of national polling maintained by pollster.com shows Obama up 49.9% to 42.9%.</p>",
  "<p>Plans for a new generation of heavily polluting coal-fired power stations were dealt a blow today in Europe when MEPs voted for tough regulations which would force energy companies to fit expensive equipment to trap the emissions.</p> <p>The carbon dioxide emissions limit set by the European Parliament environment committee is the same as that set by California - 500 grams of CO2 per kilowatt/hour. Anti-coal campaigners in the US claim this has effectively outlawed coal power being sold to the state.</p> <p>However the committee also voted for a \u20ac10bn (\u00a37.8bn) fund to pay for trials of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which could trap most emissions. This could enable some coal stations to be built, using the EU funds to pay for the massive expected costs of CCS.</p> <p>The amendments to the draft Directive on Geological Storage of<br>Carbon Dioxide still have to pass at least two further levels. One is the powerful European council of environment ministers, where there is likely to be strong lobbying by some states, including coal-rich Poland. But environment campaigners hailed the decision as a \"huge development\".</p> <p>Development charity Oxfam said the new emissions performance standard, which would apply to all power stations from 2015, would \"rule out\" plans for the first new coal plant for a generation in the UK, proposed by E.ON at Kingsnorth in Kent. </p> <p>Although the UK government is expected to announce a small CCS trial next year, possibly at Kingsnorth, even supporters of CCS admit it would not be available at commercial scale until 2020 at least, and some experts claim it will be much later. </p> <p>Greenpeace executive director, John Sauven, said: \"Emissions performance standards have already worked to stop new coal-fired power stations in California, and it's a welcome development that Europe is adopting a similar principle here. If this European proposal becomes law, E.ON's plans for a new plant at Kingsnorth would not be able to go ahead in their current form.\"</p> <p>Delia Villagrasa of wildlife charity WWF said the ruling would impact 50 new coal-fired plants planned across Europe, including up to eight in the UK. \"The emissions limit is a crucial step to avoid a return to dirty coal in the EU, to combat climate change effectively and to support clean power,\" she added.</p> <p>However Caroline Lucas, the Green MEP and leader of the UK Green Party, warned that any power station built before 2015 could escape the tougher regulations - including potentially Kingsnorth if it was given the go ahead in the next few months. \"The implications for Kingsnorth, and the other coal fired power stations the government is planning, is that, as long as they're built before 2015, they can go ahead without CCS - bringing with them devastating consequences for the climate,\" said Lucas. </p> <p>Other environment campaigners said the committee - which only failed to pass a 400g limit by one vote - was likely to initiate increasingly tough emissions standards which would make investors nervous of building new coal generators.</p> <p>The MEPs vote came on the day that the UK government's independent Climate Change Committee recommended a target to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">cut greenhouse gas emissions by \"at least 80%\" by 2050</a>, including for the first time aviation and international shipping.</p> <p>If the recommendation is accepted in full by the new energy and climate department, it would also effectively bar new coal-fired power stations in the UK without full carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment.</p> <p>Despite strong lobbying against it, the European Parliament environment committee also voted nearly unanimously in favour of a controversial increase in the 2020 EU emissions reduction target from 20% to 30% if there is international agreement, and for longer term reductions of 60-80% by 2050.</p> <p>Lucas said: \"While the Greens regret that the legislation has not been based on a 30% reduction from the outset, we are glad that attempts to undermine the automatic increase of the target were not successful.\"</p> <p>\"In addition, MEPs voted in favour of setting out long term emissions reductions targets - 50% by 2035 and 60-80% by 2050. This is crucial for the credibility of the EU in playing a lead role in the negotiation of a meaningful international climate deal.\"</p>",
  "<p>The West Ham vice chairman Asgeir Fridgeirsson insisted today that the club will not be affected by the Icelandic bank Landsbanki going into receivership and that the future of the club remains stable despite the economic turmoil affecting the bank. </p> <p>Iceland's banking system was thrown into chaos today when the government took control of Landsbanki, the second biggest bank in the country, to stop it collapsing. West Ham's chairman, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, is a major shareholder in the bank and chaired the company until he was sacked today.</p> <p>\"He (Gudmundsson) is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him, but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family,\" said Fridgeirsson. \"I don't think there's any reason to be too pessimistic. West Ham United is a wonderful club and a well-run company. This investment was very important for him, but not his only one ... There is no reason to fear that he will not honour his commitment to West Ham football club.\"</p> <p>The financial problems that Gudmundsson is experiencing have led to suggestions that West Ham's new manager Gianfranco Zola will have no money to spend on improving his squad when the transfer window re-opens on January 1. Fridgeirsson revealed Gudmundsson has invested \u00a330m in the club since taking over as chairman last December. He did say, however, that any future transfers would have to be financed by player sales because the squad is already too big.</p> <p>\"Our manager agrees it is not necessary for the squad to be that size so for further transfers the money would need to be generated from sales,\" said Fridgeirsson. \"There is no intention for him to invest further in the club at the moment. The club is standing strong, it is generating revenue and Mr Gudmundsson is not going to take money out of the club.\"</p> <p>Worries had been raised about the financial stability of the club even before Landsbanki went into receivership. Last month West Ham were left with a potential \u00a35m shortfall after the club's shirt sponsor XL went bust. Then two weeks ago an independent tribunal ruled against West Ham in the Carlos Tevez transfer affair, leaving them liable to a \u00a330m compensation claim. The club have since revealed they intend to appeal that decision.</p> <p>Newspaper reports last weekend suggested that Indian billionaire Anil Ambani is poised to make a bid for the club. Fridgeirsson admitted that several parties were interested in buying the club, but said Gudmundsson had no plans to sell. \"There have been agents all around the club trying to get our attention but we have turned them away,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>When I moved from my native Canada to the UK in 2003, I thought it was ironic that the Doctorows had returned to Europe. My father was born to Polish-Russian parents in a refugee camp in Azerbaijan just before the second world war ended. My grandparents \u2013 deserting Red Army conscriptees \u2013 destroyed their documents and became, in the parlance of the day, Displaced People.</p> <p>When the war ended, they went west again, but when they reached Russia, they kept going. When they reached Poland, they kept going. They moved with the great refugee herd into Germany, to a camp near Hamburg (where my aunt was born), before boarding a refugee boat and sailing to the port of Halifax, where an immigration official truncated their names \u2013 Doctorowicz became Doctorow \u2013 and gave them a train ticket to Toronto, where my great-uncle Max and his family lived.</p> <p>My grandmother is still alive, and sharp as a tack. I asked her recently why they didn't stay in the Soviet Union. Despite her aversion to military service, she was a war hero. She had gone through her adolescence as a civil defence worker during the hard years of the Siege of Leningrad, digging trenches and hauling bodies as a girl of 12, until she was evacuated to Siberia at the age of 15. Her family still lived in Leningrad \u2013 mother, father, baby brother. Leningrad is a majestic city, cosmopolitan and vibrant, even with the war scars on its face. In Toronto she knew no one, didn't speak the language. Her years as a refugee would stretch out for decades until she could truly consider herself a Canadian.</p> <p>I asked her why she didn't stay, and she shook her head like I'd asked the stupidest possible question. \"It was the Soviet Union\", she said. She waved her hand, groped for the answer. \"Papers,\" she said, finally. \"We had to carry papers. The police could stop you at any time and make you turn over your papers.\" The floodgates opened. They spied on you. They made you spy on each other. Your grandfather wouldn't have been allowed to stay \u2013 he was Polish, they wouldn't let him stay with the family in Russia, he'd have to go back to Poland.</p> <p>My head bobbed unconsciously as she told me this. I knew all of it, by way of innuendos and hints over the years, but I had never heard her say it all at once. I'd even seen it firsthand, when we visited the family in Leningrad in 1984, having our conversations cut short when they strayed into political territory, with over-the-shoulder looks for the snoops who might be listening in and waiting to turn my family in to the KGB.</p> <p>Half a century later, the Doctorows came back to Europe. I set up residence in London, working for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an American civil liberties nonprofit, running the European operations. I was privileged to be given status as a \"highly skilled migrant\" (the only visa category I qualified for, given my lack of a university degree). A few years later, I was living with my partner, and had fathered a British daughter (when I mentioned this to a UK immigration official at Heathrow, he sneeringly called her \"half a British citizen\"). We were planning a giant family wedding in Toronto when the news came down: the Home Secretary had unilaterally, on 24 hours' notice, changed the rules for highly skilled migrants to require a university degree. My immigration lawyers confirmed it: people who'd established residence in the UK for years and years, who'd built businesses and employed Britons here, who owned homes and given birth to British children, were being thrown out of the country, taking their tax-payments, jobs and families with them.</p> <p>My partner and I scrambled. We got married. We applied for a spousal visa. A few weeks later, I presented myself in Croydon at the Home Office immigration centre to turn over my biometrics and have a visa glued into my Canadian passport. I got two years' breathing room. My family could stay in Britain.</p> <p>Then came last week's announcement: effective immediately, spousal visa holders (and foreign students) would be issued mandatory, biometric radio-frequency ID papers that we will have to carry at all times. And I started to look over my shoulder.</p> <p>Once again, it seems as though the Doctorows may have to leave Europe. The identity card I'm to be issued when I renew my visa is intended to be linked to all my daily activities: my medical care, my use of transit, my banking and finance, my tax \u2013 a single identifier that will track me through time and space, forever. The dossier thus gathered on me will be managed by the same agencies that have lost (literally) tens of millions' worth of records on British people in the past year alone.</p> <p>It will all be tied to my biometric identifiers, such as fingerprints. Unless you wear gloves at all times, you leave these identifiers behind continuously, everywhere you go. These identifiers are not only available to law enforcement and the state, but to anyone who cares to lift them off any smooth surface you happen to touch. Once these identifiers are compromised, there is no means \u2013 short of amputation \u2013 to change them. Consider the case of German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schauble, who advocates biometric IDs: his fingerprints were lifted from a water-glass at a public debate and published on 10,000 pieces of acetate by a group of media pranksters with no budget and who stood to gain no financial benefit from the stunt. Will well-heeled identity thieves who can use these biometrics to commit crimes and empty bank accounts be less resourceful?</p> <p>The identity card will emit my personal information to people who are at a great distance from me, without my knowledge or consent. The RFID tags in the cards are advertised as only being readable at a few centimetres' distance, like an Oyster card, but, like an Oyster card, security researchers have shown that these cards can be read at tens of metres, and can be cloned using cheap, off-the-shelf technology.</p> <p>So it's fortunate that I got my spousal visa when I did, before these identity papers were made mandatory. Indeed, it's fortunate that I received my spousal visa at all, as Labour moves to limit the number of annual new visas of all kinds to 20,000 people, meaning that Britons who marry foreigners can no longer be assured that they will be able to settle and raise their families in the UK.</p> <p>The national ID card does not exist in a vacuum. It is part of an unprecedented, unparalleled programme to use technology to spy upon and control the movements of people in the UK. Our internet connections are censored and wiretapped by advertisers. Soon, our ISPs will be forced to log and retain the details of all our online activity for snooping by governments, bored employees, or any crook who can hack or bribe his way into the surveillance databases. Our image is captured hundreds of times every time we leave the house. Our number-plates are photographed hundreds of times by traffic cameras, creating a record of where we've been. Our Oyster card data is logged and made available to police, snoops, crooks and anyone else with the resources to get hold of it.</p> <p>We can be arrested and held for weeks without charge. Government tells academics which freely available information about terrorists they are allowed to study and what they are not allowed to look at.</p> <p>We are encouraged to spy on our neighbours and report their suspicious activity. We can be stopped and searched with no particularised suspicion, and during these searches, police officers can and do examine such things as the books we're reading and the personal notes we've made.</p> <p>Every one of these measures was beta-tested on less-advantaged groups before it was rolled out to the general public. CCTVs used the be the exclusive territory of bank vaults and prisons. Network wiretapping and censorship began in schools, \"to protect children\".</p> <p>Now, we immigrants are to be the beta testers for Britain's sleepwalk into the surveillance society. We will have to carry internal passports and the press will say, \"If you don't like it, you don't have to live here \u2013 it's unseemly for a guest to complain about the terms of the hospitality.\" But this beta test is not intended to stop with immigrants. Government freely admits that immigrants are only the first stage of a universal rollout of mandatory biometric RFID identity cards. What happens to us now will happen to you, next.</p> <p>Not me, though. If the government of the day when I renew my visa in 2010 requires that I carry these papers as a condition of residence, the Doctorows will again leave their country and find a freer one. My wife \u2013 born here, raised here, with family here \u2013 is with me. We won't raise our British daughter in the database nation. It's not safe.</p>",

  "<p>As mornings after go, there are few combinations more deadly than a computer, too much alcohol and a seething sense of indignation. </p> <p>But there could soon be a solution for people who cannot resist sending an ill-conceived drunken email to their boss or a former lover.</p> <p>An altruistic Google employee has come up with a system that will block \u2014 or at least make people reconsider sending \u2014 the type of message they will probably regret the next day. </p> <p>Mail Goggles, which can be set to spring into action late at night and at weekends, asks emailers to <a href=\"http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-in-labs-stop-sending-mail-you-later.html\">answer a series of short maths questions</a> before sending a message. The basic addition and multiplication sums have to be completed within a time limit.</p> <p>The idea, according to the Gmail engineer Jon Perlow, is to help those who are a little too tired and emotional to foresee the consequences of their actions.</p> <p>\"Sometimes I send messages I shouldn't send,\" Perlow confessed on the Gmail blog. </p> <p>\"Like the time I told that girl I had a crush on her over text message. Or the time I sent that late-night email to my ex-girlfriend that we should get back together.\"</p> <p>The programme, he said, was designed to establish whether \"you're really sure you want to send that late-night Friday email \u2026 what better way to check than by making you solve a few simple maths problems after you click send to verify you're in the right state of mind?\".</p> <p>Even communications experts occasionally need a moment to take a deep breath and check what they have written and to whom they are writing. </p> <p>Three years ago, Alastair Campbell was forced into what passed for an apology after accidentally using his Blackberry to tell the BBC what he thought of the corporation's journalism. </p> <p>Unfortunately, he dispatched the email \u2014 which read \"Fuck off and cover something important you twats!\" \u2014 to a reporter on the BBC's Newsnight programme rather than Labour's advertising advisers.</p> <p>In a later email to the journalist, the former Downing Street communications chief admitted he was \"not very good at this email Blackberry malarkey\", adding: \"Campbell swears shock. </p> <p>\"Final sentence of earlier email probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met, but I'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P[axman].\"</p>",
  "<p>The decision by the independent party funding watchdog, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/06/partyfunding.conservatives\">Electoral Commission</a>, to clear the Conservative party of breaking the law by using a commercial company to funnel millions of pounds of services to marginal seats is brilliant news for the Tories. But it is not very good news for anybody else.</p> <p>It is the latest example of a watchdog that neither barks nor bites. At stake was whether a party could get round the rules, which insist that all donations to political parties are transparent and campaign spending is limited by law. Constituency Campaigning Services \u2013 funded by millionaire donors that then charged commercial rates to Conservative party associations to provide leaflets and call centres for Tories fighting Labour and Liberal Democrat marginal seats \u2013 enabled the Tory party to avoid publishing its accounts and drove a coach and horses through spending limits set during election campaigns. The commission has ruled \u2013 with one small exception \u2013 that this was perfectly alright. This is because it charged these constituencies' associations commercial rates and they could not find a written contract between the party and the organisation. This misses the point.</p> <p>The implications are enormous not only for the Tories but for any other party that decides to copy them. The Electoral Commission has provided a loophole and it is not the first time.</p> <p>It came under fire by the Committee on Standards in Public Life over its failure to rule on the rate for commercial loans to political parties in the run up to the 2005 election. This made it impossible for assistant commander John Yates of Scotland Yard to prosecute either Labour or the Tories during the \"cash for peerages\" investigation for getting hidden subsidies.</p> <p>And so far it seems little interested in the recent allegations on <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/dispatches/camerons+money+men/2471062\">Channel 4's Dispatches</a> that a British firm, Bearwood Corporate Finance \u2013 the company of choice for Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, one of the Tories biggest donors \u2013 gave cash to the party that could have been funded from that transferred from Belize. Sir Alistair Graham, former head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, has called for an inquiry. </p> <p>The commission was supposed to have got its act together. But this does not seem to be the case. There is legislation before parliament at the moment to change electoral law. Jack Straw, the justice secretary, should look at these recent rulings and tighten it up. A new law requiring organisations to submit accounts to the Electoral Commission would be a start.</p>",

For instance, there's a young Australian singer-songwriter called Lisa Mitchell who is looking very impressive, not just because she's only 18, a month younger than Laura Marling, but also because she's a former contestant on the 2006 edition of Australian Idol and we know what a bunch of karaoke clothes' horses and wailing wannabes that lot tend to be. Not that we're anti-pop TV snobs or have an aversion to former contestants \u2013 Girls Aloud's new single is an absolute stormer by any measure \u2013 but those shows gauge vocal prowess and nothing else. And there's more to Mitchell than an ability to hold a note, although she does that very well indeed, even if her voice is perhaps too idiosyncratic for one of those reality programmes, a little too quavery, kooky and girly. This is probably why she only came sixth on Aussie Idol despite sterling performances of Blondie's Heart of Glass and Coldplay's See You Soon. She should have done Throbbing Gristle's Discipline.</p> <p>Her voice better suits her own songs, which she's been working on back in England, where she was born in Kent before moving with her parents when she was three to Albury in New South Wales. The musicians she's been writing with cover the waterfront, stylistically, and include Turin Brakes, Andy Barlow (Lamb), Sacha Skarbek (James Blunt, Adele), Craig Dodds (Sugababes, Natty, Amy Winehouse), Sam Dixon (Will Young) and Dann Hume of NZ indie-rock band Evermore. Of all the people she's been collaborating with, though, it's acclaimed - but thus far wildly unsuccessful - British singer-songwriter Ed Harcourt (co-writer and keyboardist on her forthcoming debut album) who appears to have made the biggest impression on her music \u2013 a series of candy-coated folk-pop lullabies with deft arrangements and delicate melodies. They've got Harcourt's lightness of touch and blend of the sweet and savage. Meanwhile, production on the album is courtesy Anthony Whiting who has worked with MIA. Mitchell's views on the War On Terror and commitment to the cause of the Tamil Tigers are, as yet, unknown.</p> <p>The name of another singer-songwriter occurs listening to forthcoming single Neapolitan Dreams - Bic Runga, New Zealand's most popular female musician, who also does cute but deadly. We're not the only ones to discern a slightly eerie quality here - one particular washing-liquid company has just used Neapolitan Dreams on their latest advert, and it's more like a Bj\u00f6rk video or a fantasy snippet from Alice In Wonderland than a 60-second soap ad. In fact, it has already been hailed by one wag as The Best Laundry Detergent Ad \u2026 Ever! Surf's up.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Neapolitan Dreams is a cute and soft tinder-box lullaby. But scratch the surface and it splinters into a kaleidoscope of imagery displaying an emotional breadth that 18-year-olds are not often given the chance to showcase.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> She's Joanna Newsom's cuddly but edgy kid sister.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make Persil jealous.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Advertise Neapolitan ice-cream.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Neapolitan Dreams is released by Sony on January 19, with the album Paint It Gold to follow in May 2009.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Bic Runga, Joanna Newsom, Laura Marling, Lisa Germano.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/lisalisamitchell\">www.myspace.com/lisalisamitchell</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Violens. </p>",
  "<p>China cancelled a visit to Washington by a senior general, slapped an indefinite ban on port calls by US naval vessels, and cancelled low-level diplomatic exchanges with the US today, in angry retaliation to a US plan to sell $6.5bn in advanced weaponry to Taiwan. </p> <p>A spokesman for China's foreign ministry in Beijing, Qin Gang, said the US move broke international law and would cast a shadow over bilateral relations. The proposed sale \"has contaminated the sound atmosphere for our military relations and gravely jeopardised China's national security\", Qin said.</p> <p>China regards Taiwan, which has enjoyed de facto independence since 1949, as a renegade province. But its aim to unify the island with the mainland is opposed by a majority of Taiwanese. Under a 1979 law, the US in effect pledged to help Taiwan defend itself against any attempt by China to forcibly acquire the territory.</p> <p>A Pentagon spokesman described China's reaction to the sale as \"unfortunate\" and said it would lead to missed opportunities. But both sides appeared to be anxious to limit the fallout from the row. US-China cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues in Iran and North Korea was not expected to be affected.</p> <p>The arms sale was first proposed by the US in 2001 but ran into opposition in Taiwan's parliament, the Legislative Yuan, as well as in Beijing. It was initially valued at $12bn and potentially included Aegis-class frigates, submarines and advanced F16 fighter jets.</p> <p>The current package is much less ambitious, consisting of defensive weapons systems. It includes 330 Patriot ground-to-air missiles, 30 Apache helicopters, 182 Javelin anti-tank missiles and spare parts for Taiwan's existing fleet of F16 fighters. The Pentagon also announced a sale of Harpoon missiles last month.</p> <p>China has rapidly expanded its overall military spending in recent years and has deployed an estimated 1,000 missiles across the strategic Taiwan Strait, facing Taiwan.</p> <p>Prickly US relations with Taiwan have eased since the election as president last March of the nationalist Kuomintang party (KMT) leader and former Taipei mayor, Ma Ying-jeou.</p> <p>Ma's predecessor as president, the Democratic Progressive party's (DPP) Chen Shui-bian, angered Washington and Beijing by pushing what both saw as a destabilising pro-independence agenda. That may have led to an undeclared freeze on new arms sales.</p> <p>Ma has taken a series of steps to improve cross-straits relations since taking office, including direct charter flights for businesspeople and tourists, a lifting of caps on Taiwanese investment in China, and the opening of permanent representative offices in both countries.<br>Taiwan also provided assistance to China during last May's Sichuan earthquake disaster.</p> <p>As a result of the thaw, Chen Yun-lin, the top official in charge of China's Taiwan policy, is expected to visit the island soon. If it takes place, it will be the highest-level contact since 1949.</p> <p>All the same, Ma's popularity has been falling amid DPP criticism that he was kow-towing to China and failing to obtain reciprocal concessions. His decision to risk China's displeasure and go ahead with the arms purchase may help him counter perceptions of undue servility towards the mainland.</p> <p>\"We think this announcement from the US government is a sign that the past eight years of discord are over,\" Ma said in a statement.</p> <p>According to a report last month by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), a US decision on the sale had been expected before the Bush administration leaves office in January.</p> <p>Defence analysts suggested the White House wanted to push the deal through now rather than leave the decision to the incoming, possibly Democratic administration.</p> <p>Embroiled in major conflicts in the Middle East, Washington has been keen to defuse cross-straits tensions and persuade the Taiwanese to take more responsibility for their own defence.</p> <p>Yet now this appears to be happening, there are signs of second thoughts. According to the CRS report, a closer relationship between China and Taiwan \"may complicate US regional interests\".</p>",
  "<p>A senior police officer today told the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes that another innocent person could be shot dead in future.</p> <p>Cressida Dick, the deputy assistant commissioner in charge of the Scotland Yard control room during the pursuit of De Menezes, warned that the situation \"could happen again\".</p> <p>De Menezes, 27, was shot in the head seven times at Stockwell tube station, in south London, on July 22 2005 after being mistaken for the failed suicide bomber Hussain Osman.</p> <p>The inquest was shown a police sketch of the scene on the tube train after the shooting. The sketch depicted a stick man lying on the floor alongside a row of seats. </p> <p>Maria Otone de Menezes, the victim's mother, sat with her head bowed as Dick was questioned about the sketch, which was included in a police log of events. </p> <p>Dick said police set out to reduce the risk to the public, but admitted this could only be done to a \"less than perfect extent\" when terrorists were on the run.</p> <p>Michael Mansfield QC, the counsel for the De Menezes family, asked her if the fatal shooting of an innocent person could happen again.</p> <p>\"I'm afraid, sir, I do believe that this, or something like this, could happen again,\" she replied.</p> <p>Dick said operations were high risk \"because of the nature of the threat that we face from suicide terrorists, and the difficulty that there is in dealing with such a threat and the very fast timescale in which these things can happen\".</p> <p>She said she feared that, in the future, a terrorist might manage to set off a bomb, which would expose the police to \"huge scrutiny\".</p> <p>\"And equally, I pray it doesn't happen, but it is possible that an innocent member of the public might die in circumstances like this,\" she added.</p> <p>Mansfield alleged that police were \"sprinting to catch up with something that had not been properly organised\" throughout the morning of July 22 2005, a claim denied by Dick.</p> <p>Mansfield asked her whether she had been \"on the ball\" as undercover officers staked out the block of flats where de Menezes lived. </p> <p>She admitted that the Scotland Yard operations room where she was working had been busy, but insisted she was \"very fresh\" and well-prepared. </p> <p>\"I was very, very focused. I would say I was extremely on the ball \u2026 I felt very well-prepared for the role I had to do,'' she said.</p> <p>\"It was busy - I didn't leave the room until 11.30am for the first time - and there was a great deal going on. During that time, I was continuously talking to people and making decisions. </p> <p>\"I would not describe myself as rushed off my feet, certainly not.\" </p> <p>The inquest heard that Dick told another senior officer at the end of the day that the first hour of the operation had been \"appalling\".</p> <p>She said she had been referring to the lack of structure common in the early stages of responding to unplanned major incidents.</p> <p>\"Are you telling the British public that the average big operation starts with an appalling structure?\" Mansfield asked.</p> <p>Dick replied: \"You can't get everything in terms of planning right immediately, so there is always a period of needing to get the structure right.\"</p> <p>She denied that either she or Scotland Yard had a problem with admitting that things had gone wrong, saying she regarded herself as \"somebody who will always take full responsibility for what I have done\".</p> <p>The inquest heard that, early on July 22, a senior officer - identified only as \"Alan\" - ordered a firearms team to go to a block of flats linked to Osman in Tulse Hill, south London, but this did not happen.</p> <p>In the event, De Menezes walked out of the same block, where he was living at the time, and was allowed to enter Stockwell tube station, where he was confronted by armed police.</p> <p>Mansfield asked if she accepted there were \"serious breakdowns in communication at the very least on that night\".</p> <p>She responded: \"I don't know that, sir... If that is what happened, then that sounds like a miscommunication.\"</p> <p>Dick told Mansfield she was \"not surprised\" when the firearms team commander told her two specialist police marksmen had fired nine or 10 shots at De Menezes's head.</p> <p>\"I don't think I had any reaction, sir. He was giving me information,\" she said.</p> <p>Yesterday, Dick choked back tears as she told the inquest at the Oval cricket ground, in south London, that she thought about what happened on July 22 every day. </p> <p>She described the death of De Menezes as an \"awful tragedy\", but insisted the police did nothing wrong.</p> <p>The inquest has heard that officers on the trail of the failed July 21 bombers were ordered to stop everybody coming out of a Tulse Hill address linked to Osman on the morning of July 22.</p> <p>However, it transpired that the address, 21 Scotia Road, was part of a block of flats with a communal entrance.</p> <p>De Menezes was followed by surveillance officers after emerging from the block at around 9.34am. He was shot dead at the underground station 32 minutes later.</p>",
  "<p>Among the talking points Sarah Palin was able to successfully regurgitate in last Thursday's vice-presidential debate was the claim that \"Barack Obama had said that all we're doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing civilians.\" Palin insisted that \"such a reckless, reckless comment and untrue comment, again, hurts our cause.\"</p> <p>Such a comment would be objectionable, if indeed Obama had ever said such a thing. But Palin's version, which she has continued to repeat in speeches this week, is a blatantly deceitful truncation of a statement Obama made in August 2007, while discussing <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/14/AR2007081400812.html\">his plan to strengthen the struggling US-led effort in Afghanistan</a>. \"We've got to get the job done there,\" Obama said. \"And that requires us to have enough troops so that we're not just air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous problems there.\"</p> <p>Independent fact-checkers have <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/10/06/mccain-ad-challenges-obama-on-afghanistan/\">corrected Palin's distortion</a>, as was done with regard to the campaign's claim that Palin <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/sep/23/bridge-too-far-bridge-nowhere/\">\"killed the Bridge to Nowhere\"</a> and its constant <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/there_he_goes_again.html\">misrepresentations of Obama's tax plan</a>. But once again McCain has chosen to double down on the lie, using the truncated quote in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14308.html\">a new ad calling Obama \"dishonourable\"</a>. Thus does the Straight Talk Express sink deeper into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slough_of_Despond\">Slough of Despond</a>.</p> <p>McCain and Palin's attacks are regrettable not only for their mendacity, but because they disregard a forthright critique of the deepening crisis in Afghanistan. This is a particularly grievous pass for McCain, who has made his commitment to national security central to the argument for his presidency, but has now shown that he won't let that commitment get in the way of an opportunity for invective. </p> <p>Obama's comments came in the context of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/02/AR2007050202757.html\">mounting Afghan protests</a> at the civilian casualties caused by US-led operations there. An Associated Press fact-check backed up Obama's statement, noting that western forces in Afghanistan were <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/14/AR2007081400950.html\">killing civilians at a faster rate than the insurgents</a> were killing civilians. As of August 1, 2007, \"while militants killed 231 civilians in attacks in 2007, western forces killed 286.\" </p> <p>At the UN last month, Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, told the assembly that the deaths of civilians in bombing raids could seriously undermine the efforts to fight terrorism. Karzai said that these deaths hurt <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/09/24/un-afghan.html?ref=rss\">\"the credibility of the Afghan people's partnership with the international community,\"</a> making attempts at cooperation much more problematic for an Afghan government struggling to establish its legitimacy. </p> <p>Minimising civilian casualties is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/washington/05doctrine.html\">key to a successful counterinsurgency effort</a>, which is one reason air strikes - which tend to result in a lot of collateral damage, ie dead civilians - are <a href=\"http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2008/May/Pages/InTodays2271.aspx\">poorly suited to the task</a>. The US-led effort in Afghanistan has been forced to over-rely on air power because of a shortage of troops resulting from the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12009906\">US commitment in Iraq</a>, and because anger over Iraq <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/world/asia/09gates.html?_r=1&amp;scp=22&amp;sq=allies+afghanistan&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin\">has made Nato allies reluctant</a> to step up their assistance.</p> <p>These are examples of how the invasion of Iraq - which John McCain bafflingly claims he would still support, even given the absence of either WMD or an al-Qaida connection - has undercut America's ability to fight terrorism effectively. </p> <p>It's not reckless comments that have hurt our cause, Governor Palin. It's reckless wars.</p>",
  "<p><strong>THE OLD GREY WHINGE AND GRISTLE FEST</strong></p> <p>When the president of Fifa appeared before the EU yesterday to plead for more stringent regulations governing who is permitted to buy football clubs with their own or other people's money, the Fiver felt even grimier than usual. The sweats, the anxiety, the sensation of insects crawling up our skin could mean only one thing: for the first time in living memory, we were in agreement with Sepp Blatter. </p> <p>Eugh! </p> <p>Of course the problem with Sepp is that, even when he's talking what appears to be sense, he is invariably undone by his blatant hypocrisy. Which means that when this power-crazed gravy-train merchant with little or no interest in football warns a room-full of like-minded gravy-train merchants with little or no interest in football that \"we must ask ourselves what motivates [football club] owners and are they really interested in the game or just making money,\" the eyes of most sane folk roll straight towards heaven. </p> <p>Today, the culture secretary Andy Burnham clambered aboard the Blatter bandwagon, calling for a more efficient test for wannabe owners that isn't so completely useless that wannabe owners can become owners without actually passing it. A fit-and-proper fit-and-proper-persons test, as it were. \"It should be applied before they take over the club, not after the event as it is at the moment. Then at least we can have more confidence in the people coming in to own English football clubs,\" said Burnham, who was doing really well until he demonstrated his naivety by demanding a \"strong and reformed FA\".</p> <p>And just when you thought this story about pallid, expensive grey suit-on-suit action in the global corridors of power couldn't get any more exciting, the FA chairman Lord Tiresome stuck his neb in. \"The best estimate I could get in the City yesterday was that debts in English football as a whole have probably edged to the \u00a33bn mark,\" he droned, before adding that he's still waiting to hear back from a loft conversion specialist in Acton and a plumber in Leytonstone.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I was not happy about it\" - is Sepp Blatter down in the mouth about (a) Uefa expanding the European Nations Cup from 16 teams to 374, (b) his foie gras intravenous drip being removed, or (c) the total lack of Sarah Palin lookalikes dancing in front of him wearing only suspenders?</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>IT'S THE CUP THEY'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT (THEY BEING UEFA MARKETING EXECUTIVES, AS EVERYONE ELSE IS PAST CARING)</strong></p> <p>Back in May at Wembley, Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp lifted the FA Cup above his beaming face - which is slipping slowly to the floor, see, like Paul McCartney's - and thought \"finally my work is done, look, I've won something at last, so balls to it, I'll spend the rest of the year phoning it i ... hold on\" ... and thought \"what a beano it will be carousing round Europe for a tournament which used to be arguably harder to win than the old Big Cup but has now been shafted beyond all recognition by some Uefa marketing executive who should be kicked and kicked and hoofed and kicked in the face until every last purse-lipped feature shears off the front of his sorry sku ... hold on\" ... and thought \"I wonder if, in next season's Euro Vase, I'll get to face another chancer who is running down their career like me earning lots of money for old rope?\" Yes, we had it pretty much nailed the first time.</p> <p>So imagine how appy 'Appy Arry will be to learn that, in Stage Fun of Euro Vase, his Portsmouth side will fail to score against Milan, the eponymous heroes from the city Ronaldinho is spending his retirement in.

Oh all right, if you really must know, they've also landed Braga, Wolfsburg, Heerenveen and Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.</p> <p>Of the seven other groups of pointlessness, Group A should provide the most chortles, laughs and guffaws, as it features former English club Manchester City and former Englishman Steve McClaren, depressing mouthpiece for Dutch outfit Steve McClaren's FC Twente. \"It should be a fantashtic occashion for ush,\" shaid McClaren, before going off to pick some tulips, ride a bicycle, paint his face orange, sing two verses of <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2770333010208224769\">Oei Oei Oei Dat Was Me Weer Een Loei</a>, roll a blunt, harbour grudges about the war, and talk openly about shexsh becaush hey we're all adultsh yeah?</p> <p>Meanwhile Group Eff appears to be the least uninteresting, featuring as it does three former European champions from the era when being European champion actually meant something. Aston Villa have been grouped with Ajax and Hamburg, the latter team particularly beatable as their players can't hear themselves think for Martin Jol laughing like a drain.

At all costs, these leaders have to demonstrate to tens of millions of viewers that their leaders are in full command, their savings and deposits are safe and the EU is at one in confronting the crisis. As with climate change, it can help save the world.</p> <p>Seven leaders, seven individual statements, seven individual questions and then the show's over. Berlusconi, smoothing down his new waxed hairpiece, talks straight to the TV channels he owns and, after a brief word in Sarko's ear, talks incessantly.</p> <p>Brown, exhausted, adjusts his earpiece and scowls. Sarko and Merkel, the German chancellor who has recoiled at his physical embraces in the past, lean closer and smile tenderly into each other's face, their noses almost touching. Trichet hears a low chant of \"Basta! Basta!\" from non-Italian journos and laughs. </p> <p>Sarko, the host, goes into verbal overdrive. Soon, it's over. \"So, what's the news?\" we ask each other. \"There isn't any.\"</p> <p>A veteran Spanish colleague tells me: \"It's a disgrace. The Spanish banks are taking over yours - they're solid. Zapatero isn't invited but Berlusconi and basket-case Italy are.\" </p> <p>\"I'm ashamed every time he [Berlusconi] opens his mouth,\" another old Italian acquaintance says.</p> <p>\"So, what are you Brits going to do, <em>verdammt noch'mal</em>? It's your system, yours and the Americans', that spread this poison,\" a German friend glowers.</p> <p>It's all very collegial joking and back-patting as we head over the road to the ornate Marigny hotel - where Gadafy parked his tent in the garden - and the Elys\u00e9es <em>traiteurs</em> have prepared a spread.</p> <p>Sunday morning and the mutual recriminations are out in the open. It's every man for himself, or <em>sauve qui peut</em>, as those national crises publicly erupt, demanding beggar-thy-neighbour solutions for local electorates demanding rock-bottom guarantees for their savings \u2013 or there'll be runs on the banks all over Europe.</p> <p>It's easy, of course, to mock the punctured ambitions of the EU and its leaders, not least their 'failure' to agree on a Paulson-style bail-out plan or a pan-European regulator to police the 44 cross-border banks that control 70% of the \u20ac32tn of assets in the EU banking sector. (The man/woman on the Brussels tram has never heard of the 'Lamfalussy level three' committee of European banking supervisors which meets occasionally in London and has never voted once.)</p> <p>As Trichet said last week, the EU is, unlike the US, not a federal state. There is no political union. Eurosceptics slavering with schadenfreude cannot have it both ways: deride federalism in good times and demand it when the bad times roll. The EU is in disarray but so is everybody else. When this crisis is over, Europeans may be forced to club together more closely than they have so far.</p> <h2>Bitter pill for Belgium</h2> <p>OK, so not much chance of that right now. Take Benelux, where the once cuddly, now ruthless, Dutch have forced the dismantlement of Fortis, Belgium's biggest bancassurer, and this week's takeover, via temporary nationalisation, by BNP Paribas. (The Dutch have nationalised its Dutch operations.) </p> <p>Dismissing Belgium as a banking dwarf when, at the end of last year, Fortis ranked 19th in Europe and was worth \u20ac40bn, De Telegraaf, a Dutch newspaper, gloated this week: \"After selling its steel and energy groups in the 1980s and 1990s, the Belgians' sole remaining global role is in making beer.\"</p> <p>Sounds like we're back to post-Napoleonic Europe and the Congress of Vienna \u2013 just before Belgium revolted against Dutch control and, after a nationalist opera at La Monnaie, provoked a riot and won its independence in 1830. For a country constantly on the edge of break-up and yet still the EU capital, it's a poison pill to swallow.</p> <p>Baudouin Prot, chief executive of BNP, which has acquired Fortis's \u20ac239bn of customers' deposits to leapfrog the league table and become the eurozone's biggest retail bank for a knock-down price, didn't mince his words on Monday. Reassuring Belgian clients their accounts are safe in one of the world's top three banks by credit rating, he said: \"There was no alternative.\"</p> <p>But it didn't help that, as an international banker, he peppered his emollient phrases with English: \"C'est le proof of the pudding in the eating\" and the like, adding: \"I don't know how to say that in Belgian.\" They, of course, speak French, Dutch and German in this trilingual state.</p> <p>Anyway, if recapitalisation of Europe's banks means renationalisation so far, Prot held out the dim prospect of a counter-tendency: the ever-greater concentration of the sector in the hands of a few mega-banks. </p> <p>When I asked him whether BNP had the means to take over other banks in difficulty, he said: \"In France, we say you should not have eyes bigger than your stomach \u2026 BNP, for the moment, will be pre-occupied with integrating Fortis but that does not mean we will not do anything else.\"</p> <p>France, we know, always wanted a united Europe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise. The Germans who, 15 years ago wanted a European Germany, are now toying with the idea of a German Europe. The two could be about to fight out this battle of ideas in the EU banking sector.</p>",
  "<p>I love a good pop single, don't you? A good pop single should run and run. The world never keeps an excellent pop song down. Peter Bj\u00f6rn and John's Young Folks (from third album Writer's Block) was a mini-obsession of mine last year; the whistling, the laconic vocals of Victoria Bergman, the Scando-pop vibe - who could resist? Young Folks was infectious, poptastic and ubiquitous throughout 2006 and 2007, spreading its summery groove over the world. The omnipresence of the whistling pop song led some to question the matter of \"over exposure\". There were even protest blogs! Whatever. I still love the pop vibes of Young Folks. </p> <p>But it seems Peter Bj\u00f6rn and John had over-exposure on their mind<br>when they wrote their new album Seaside Rock, perhaps fearing being known as \"the band with the whistling song\". Seaside Rock is pure art rock, a courageous effort when the band could have prepared a carbon copy follow-up to their last album. Instead, Peter Bj\u00f6rn and John veer out of the middle of the road and straight into a ditch with \u2013 are you ready for this? \u2013 an instrumental album. </p> <p>Seaside Rock is an excellent album and follows the trend set by Neil Young in the early 70s to avoid being labeled a one-hit wonder. \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Gold_(song)\">Heart of Gold</a> ... put me in the middle of the road,\" wrote Young. \"Travelling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\" His subsequent <a href=\"http://www.thrasherswheat.org/tnfy/ditch.htm\">Ditch Trilogy</a> deconstructed the myth of Neil Young as MOR and reworked him into the popular legend he is today.</p> <p>Not only is Seaside Rock largely an instrumental album, it pays homage to a nautical Sweden with spoken word passages. Plus, it feels to me to be heavily under the influence of cult musician, composer and multi-instrumentalist, <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%25C3%25B6rn_Olsson&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DBjorn%2BOlsson.%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den\">Bj\u00f6rn Olsson</a>. </p> <p>Chances are you've never heard of Bj\u00f6rn Olsson and he seems to prefer it that way. Olsson was originally in <a href=\"http://www.unioncarbideproductions.com/\">Union Carbide Productions</a> in the 80s, a band heavily praised by Sonic Youth and REM for making \"the fourth album the Stooges never made\", keeping a strong hold on psychedelic cacophony, rock'n'roll assaults and pure energy. When UCP broke up, they regrouped as the Soundtrack of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Soundtrack+of+Our+Lives&amp;btnG=Search\">Our Lives</a>, but when they started to become popular after the release of Welcome to the Infant Freebase, Olsson left. He focused his career on production and session work, and released idiosyncratic home-recorded solo efforts.</p> <p>Olsson's music is remarkably beautiful, imbued with the pop flair of Burt<br>Bacharach, the cinematic expanse of Ennio Morricone, Caribbean grooves, and kraut space-rock. Each record is a singular vision of Olsson's compositional skills, and he often titles his efforts (The Lobster, the Crab, the Shrimp and Crayfish) after seafood and nautical themes. His recorded output is fascinating as he follows his own muse, resulting in a beguiling, confusing, and appealing back catalogue. Swedish bands name check him in playlists but often with a buyer beware - his stuff is so underground that its near impossible to find. He has no MySpace, no official website, no Facebook - just these strange and mysterious albums from a gifted, reclusive and bizarre musician.</p> <p>Seaside Rock is a genius effort, an attempt by Peter Bj\u00f6rn and John<br>to counteract the mainstream pop appeal of Young Folks and have fans rediscover them, albeit as an art band, rather than a pop band. The album follows a proud tradition: Kevin Rowland from Dexy's Midnight Runners who scored his biggest hit with Come on Eileen and then followed it up with Don't Stand Me Down, Neil Young reinvented himself with Tonight's the Night, and Lou Reed eviscerated his pop persona when he released Metal Machine Music. </p> <p>What are your favourite follow-up records that veered out of the middle of the road and into the ditch?</p>",
  "<p>Discreetly, modestly, Craig Cash has become a television treasure. He was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/mrsmertonandmalcolm/\">Mrs Merton's Malcolm</a>, and won Baftas for writing and acting in Royle Family swansong The Queen of Sheba. He also wrote and starred in the under-appreciated <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366010/\">Early Doors</a>, a beautifully observed northern Cheers, and tonight sees the first episode of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/21/bbc.television\">Sunshine</a>, a comedy drama with a serious edge which sees Steve Coogan playing gambling addict Bing, alongside Bernard Hill as his father.</p> <p>Never once appearing in the tabloids documenting his drug hell or <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzqzBGpMxQw\">\"romancing\" Courtney Love</a>, Craig Cash is happily married, and lives contentedly in the Manchester suburb of Marple. Yet at the same time he has become a real success in the back-stabbing, eye-scratching, hissy-fit-throwing world of show business. How did that happen?</p> <p>I used to work with Cash, occasionally, back in the days when he was just getting started, as a DJ on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFM_Radio\">now-defunct KFM</a>, a radio station in Stockport (where much of Sunshine is filmed.) A genuine music enthusiast, he presented a late-night indie show. One regular caller was an obviously lonely lady well into her eighties who was especially keen on the Charlatans. One night she failed to ring in. Another night passed. Cash called her on air to check she was alive (could have been a tricky moment, that) joking that he was worried she'd be frozen on the sofa buried under a pile of overcoats. In a scene redolent of one of his own comedies, KFM ran a competition to \"Win a Night Out With Craig Cash\" aimed at (and indeed won by) his elderly fan.</p> <p>Such behaviour was typical of Cash and shone through even amongst a crowded field of contemporaries. Caroline Aherne, Jon Ronson, Terry Christian and Coogan were his peers; ambitious, talented tall-poppies all more driven than he was. But former house-painter Cash's humane wit shone all the same. Through those influential friends, producers met him, liked him, realised he was incredibly talented and commissioned him again and again. </p> <p>Kindness is the golden thread that illuminates Cash's work. He likes people, and leaves space between some exquisitely realistic dialogue for subtle non-verbal moments (think of <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ikfkcBgaUzA\">Jim Royle</a> here) allowing ideas and events to sink in. Cash (and his co-writer Phil Mealey) appreciate the rhythm and rituals of working class speech, gently ribbing characters without patronising them, always with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos\">his trademark pathos</a> (a sly, grumpy misanthrope could never write like that.) </p> <p>That's really all there is to the Craig Cash story. For once, the genuine, gifted, good guy triumphs in the end. Simple as that.</p>",
  "<p>On the first day of <a hef=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr\">Id al-Fitr</a>, President <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2043606.stm\">Hamid Karzai</a> had a great treat in store for his people. In a speech he said: \"A few days ago I pleaded with the leader of the Taliban, telling him 'My brother, my dear, come back to your homeland. Come back and work for peace, for the good of the Afghan people. Stop this business of brothers killing brothers'.\" </p> <p>My brother? My dear? Yes, and yes again. Karzai is an Afghan version of the metrosexual man. He sometimes even cries publicly, though that's not to everyone's taste. My favourite Karzai moment was a couple of years ago when he told Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: \"In this country [Afghanistan], women are in charge.\" He was daydreaming, of course, but I still felt flattered. </p> <p>The truth is that Karzai has been beseeching <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1550419.stm\">Mullah Omar</a> for a long time. So, in a way, nothing new has happened. This, however, is not entirely correct because there is one new element. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up to welcome the leader of the Muslim world (not my words, Karzai's): King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. He's been asked to help enable high-level negotiations with the Taliban. Or, as one Afghan website put it: \"Karzai stretched out his arms and grabbed the Saudi King's cloak, asking the king to help him negotiate with the Taliban.\" </p> <p>And the Saudi reaction? Their king welcomed an Afghan delegation led by Abdul Ahad Shinwari, the chief of Afghanistan's state-sponsored mullahs. Then there was an editorial in the Saudi newspaper, Al-Watan, which irritated some Afghan newsmen. The editorial was penned by the paper's editor\u2013in-chief, and suggested Afghanistan is in trouble because of both al-Qaida and the Americans. Remove these two from the scene and you get a peaceful, stable country. To which an Afghan website retorted that during the Taliban regime, the Saudis had offered Mullah Omar military equipment and millions of dollars.</p> <p>The website alleged that such support continues through to this day. Quoting a source close to the Taliban, it said: \"The generosity that wealthy Saudi and Gulf Arab sheikhs are displaying now by far exceeds the openhandedness they showed during the time of the jihad against the Soviet Union \u2026\" In other words, al-Watan is not entirely honest. Or suffering from memory loss. Or both. </p> <p>As for local reaction in Afghanistan, opinions varied. Ahmad Behzad, an MP from Herat province, made clear his opposition bluntly. He <a href=\"http://paymandaily.af/spip.php?article2830\">said</a>: \"If the government and the international community entered into negotiations with the terrorists, it would be an utter disgrace. It would mean that the international community has accepted defeat in Afghanistan.\" He went on: \"The international community came here to fight terrorism, not to come to an understanding with it.\" Ouch! </p> <p>The Afghan daily Hasht-e Sobh was equally unhappy, but for different reasons. In an editorial headlined \"A deal-making that's been called peace-making\", the paper listed its <a href=\"http://www.8am.af/mashroh/1387/mizan/issue400/2.html\">objections</a>. First, negotiations are kept secret and that makes them objectionable on principle. Second, the Taliban are presently under threat because Islamabad has turned against them. Why should we offer them peace now, of all times? Third, and more importantly, if calm in Afghanistan is reached through negotiation with the Taliban, this will translate into more violence in Pakistan. After all, this has been the Pakistani experience. They tried \"for many years to ensure security in their own country by enflaming violence in Afghanistan\". But the violence finally caught up with them, too. Do unto others as you would be done by.</p> <p>Fahim Dashti, editor-in-chief of Kabul Weekly, was similarly doubtful in a recent <a href=\"http://www.rfi.fr/actufa/articles/106/article_3808.asp\">interview</a> with Radio France International's Persian service. He said the two sides in this negotiation have absolutely nothing in common. This is because the Taliban is totally against everything that Kabul apparently stands for, \"democracy, the rule of law, human rights, women's rights and free speech\". Fahim said the offer of talks could in fact be a tactic to create disharmony among the Taliban. This is because the Taliban \"are finding themselves under immense pressure because of Pakistani military operations\". In other words, they're weak and may succumb to temptation and accept the peace offer. Dashti added that the offer has another, more personal dimension. It could be Karzai's way of trying to ensure the support of the conservatives in the 2009 presidential elections. </p> <p>And here is yet another version. Since it was the English (yes the English, not the British) and the Saudis who originally created the Taliban, now they have to support them and this is how they are trying to bring the Taliban back to power. (Hang on, I thought Benazir Bhutto was the one who created the Taliban. After all, that's why she was called Taliban Mom.) </p> <p>Be this as it may, the main question is whether the people of Afghanistan support negotiation with Mullah Omar. I put this question to an Afghan journalist whose opinion I regard highly because he travels to the far corners of the country to speak to ordinary people. His answer was a solid, firm \"No\". The people most certainly don't want Mullah Omar back. What do they want? The same things that westerners want: security, electricity, running water. </p> <p>In his view, the problem is not that the Taliban is strong but that the government is weak. Here's an example. You've got a district near the Pakistani border where there are 40,000 people. But they've only 40 policemen. So a bunch of Taliban come and take over a village willy-nilly. They're not strong. We're weak. And the Saudis? Karzai's cabinet is too westernised for their taste. It's their way of trying to regain influence in the administration, by bringing back Mullah Omar. </p>",

Australia's central bank said it was relaxing its monetary policy in an effort to stop economic growth deteriorating as the mayhem in the financial markets continues.

Europe's failure to agree a coordinated rescue package for its banks was a major factor behind yesterday's sell-off, so there is pressure for progress.</p> <p>\"Until such time as the banking sector is not totally reliant on central bank intervention and until trust is restored among the banks, there can be no measurable improvement in equity prices,\" warned David Buik of Cantor Index.</p>",

  "<p>A Scottish friend of mine recently told me about a scene he witnessed on the Beijing subway, which was unusual but, he insisted, not particularly shocking to him. This is strange because it's the kind of story that used to prompt people to argue how much Chinese youth has changed and modernised.</p> <p>Two teenage girls were standing next to him on a sweaty train; one was wearing a pair of large-frame pink spectacles without lenses, sported dyed blonde pigtails and a short skirt. The other girl was \"of the tomboy style\", he said; she was wearing baggy trousers and was obviously upset for some reason. The \"cartoon girl\", as my friend called her, proceeded to comfort her friend by kissing her slowly, firstly on the lips and then on her neck and earlobes. My friend, the one from Inverness, standing a few inches away, didn't know where to look. The rest of the passengers inside the carriage all became rather quiet.</p> <p>Public displays of affection can be awkward. Snogging lesbian teenagers on the Beijing subway may be something one wants to take a photo of and put on a social network site for the world to see. But the reality is you see this kind of thing in any big city in the world. Does the fact that this happened in Beijing make it more shocking, because of the conservatism and strict social control in China? Such a view is what gives Beijing its \"gawk factor\", which basically means that a westerner in China, especially the parachute tourists, will take a sight like this and stare more than on the streets of, say, Berlin. But when will Beijing lose its \"gawk factor\"? </p> <p>First time visitors from the west, if they decide to attend a rock concert in Beijing, Shanghai or Wuhan, may have a similar reaction, lavishing it with praise such as, \"This is wonderful, for China!\", \"I thought the communist regime, the autocracy and the repression couldn't produce rock or punk!\" or, \"This is amazing and they're singing about Zhongnanhai!\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongnanhai\">Zhongnanhai</a> is the off-limits residence in central Beijing for top government officials. It's also the brand name of the most popular cigarettes in Beijing. <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/carsickcars\">Carsick Cars</a>, some say the most popular rock band in the underground Beijing rock scene, wrote a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=-NYK4mXvMT8\">song called Zhongnanhai</a>. \"Life cannot be without Zhongnanhai!\" They sing, which can be interpreted as people not being able to live without the government or the cigarettes. Every time they sing the song, which has become something of an anthem in the popular indie scene, Chinese kids toss cigarettes onto the stage. For them it is about displaying their spirit and attitude, not about opposing the system they are living in.</p> <p>The main singer of punk rock band Subs, <a href=\"http://www.smartshanghai.com/blog/947/Interview:_Kang_Mao_of_SUBS.html\">Kang Mao</a>, is famed for her crazed, electric stage persona. She has been likened to Karen O of New York punk rockers Yeah Yeah Yeahs (\"Wow! This is China? But Subs is so punk!\"). </p> <p>But off-stage this punk fiend showed me just how clued-up she is. Neither impulsive, reactional or sensational, she seems to know exactly what she's doing with her punk rock band Subs, which toured Norway and Finland in 2005 and closed for several thousand at Oslo's \u00d8ya festival. </p> <p>The night I met her she was getting ready to perform at 13 Club in Beijing for a vegan cause \u2013 \"don't eat friends\". She is hip and unique. And the way that she radiates energy and intelligence is far removed from the shock when you first see her on stage, rocking out in her sexy outfit and throaty voice. But there is, at the same time, something homogenous in her way of thinking, which is basically that of any rock star. Kang Mao is no different to other rockers: she won't toe the line.</p> <p>When it comes to modern youth culture, there really is no such thing as \"made in China\". Punk music is a direct reaction against Chinese conservatism just as it was against British conservatism before. Chinese rock acts and Chinese young people should be compared to their international counterparts. Their actions should not be deemed outrageous or exotic or refreshing just because they're Chinese. Maybe just rebellious. If something fails to shock you in the west, why should it shock you in China? Nor does it signal a regime change \u2013 in the same way that it doesn't in another country. After all, Chinese people have the same desires and urges as people in the west, but perhaps just don't expect the next gay pride parade to hit Beijing.</p>",
  "<h2>What to do and see</h2> <p><strong>The Ceremony of the Keys</strong><br>Posted by <strong>laurencelondon </strong><br>Prancing around London in the middle of the night with a bunch of old men in fancy dress. No, this is not some kind of post-modern theatre, but an ancient ritual that has taken place pretty much every night for the past 700 years. The Ceremony of the Keys involves a complex set of rituals to ensure that the Tower of London is locked up good and proper. At exactly 9.53pm each and every night the Chief Warder, in his regal red coat and somewhat bonkers Tudor bonnet, carrying the Queen's Key and a giant lantern, marches around the perimeter of the Tower of London locking up the gates, accompanied by Foot Guards, sentries and various other characters straight out of the history books. Complete with archaic greetings, a bugler and the best costumes you're ever likely to see. </p> <p>\u2022 The Ceremony of the Keys is free, but permission to accompany requires a written letter.

Nearest Tube Tower Hill.</p> <p><strong>Hackney Marshes nature reserve</strong><br>Posted by <strong>pickles </strong><br>Lurking in the hinterland that is Hack-Hack-Hackney, this little bit of east has most definitely missed out on the regeneration, but it's also missed out on the outlaw years of estates, grime and crime. It's a beautiful spot offering tranquility amid the sprawl, where you can stroll along the river, watch the wildlife scuttle by, catch a real odd (but truly unique) pint at the <a href=\"http://www.myhackney.co.uk/hackney/bars&amp;Music-review-anchor_and_hope.htm\">Anchor and Hope</a>, or pick up a fry-up at the cafe opposite Lea Valley Marina. Beautiful, chilled and totally hidden.</p> <p><strong>Little Angel Theatre and New River Walk</strong><br>Posted by <strong>hearthrug </strong><br>The Little Angel Theatre is a marionette (or puppet) theatre. It's a little gem hidden away in Islington behind the bustle of Upper Street and Essex Road. It's a tiny building on Dagmar Passage.</p> <p>The puppet masters are just that - masters of their art. I used to go with a friend and we were often the only adults there without children, but many shows have two levels of interpretation and you certainly don't have to be a child to enjoy them.</p> <p>Before or after the show have a stroll along the New River Walk, running between Canonbury (The Marquess Estate) and the Angel. It's a lovely linear park based around the river that used to bring water to London from the country. It's beautifully peaceful, and there are ducks to watch (or feed) and benches to sit and contemplate. You could do a round walk down the park and back up Upper Street to Highbury and Islington tube and get the best of shops, cafe, theatre and park for a day's entertainment.</p> <p>\u2022 14 Dagmar Passage, <a href=\"http://www.littleangeltheatre.com/lat/\">littleangeltheatre.com</a>.

The route takes in Ludgate Hill, St Paul's, Bank of England, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, Victoria Street, the Strand and much more. The cost is 90 pence (with an Oystercard) so is far better value than the tour companies.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea Physic Gardens</strong><br>Posted by <strong>kaird</strong><br>Right in the middle of Chelsea is a wonderful secret garden.

But the nicest thing is just to sit there with a book on a sunny day. The cafe also sells some gorgeous food, especially the salads and the cakes.</p> <p>Note that it isn't open every day, and it does cost to get in. Details on the website.

The whole lot costs just \u00a310 and there are snacks and drinks.</p> <p>Great for a romantic evening, learning a new skill, meeting a diverse set of people with something in common, and exploring a new part of London.

This is a remarkable privilege since all four Inns of Court are still the main workplaces for large numbers of barristers.</p> <p>The Inner Temple offers the added attraction of Temple Church (built in the 1200s), one of five medieval round churches in England and as stunning architecturally as it is unusual.</p> <p>\u2022 Lincoln's Inn, Inner Temple, Middle Temple and Gray's Inn.

You can then wander through a secret door into a space where you can play delicately on a dulcimer, or bash out a tune with flip flops on some special pipes.</p> <p>Next door there are some darkened, mysterious rooms full of mummies, voodoo shrines and bizarre objects of intrigue from around the world.</p> <p>Wander out of the galleries and into a fab new aquarium with real waves. There are sci fi-like jelly fish, haughty seahorses, and starfish like jesters' hats. Wonder at the groovy anemones!

There is no garbled commentary (that's so common on the leisure boats) and it runs from Millbank (Tate Britain) to O2 at Greenwich stopping at all the usual sights (Tower of London, London Eye, The Globe, Greenwich etc).</p> <p>All seats have good views and there is a bar serving snacks, coffee, soft drinks, wine and beer at reasonable prices. The boats get busy towards the end of the day, especially travelling east. You may have to wait for the next boat, or make your way home by bus or tube.

It dates back to medieval times, but the current version dates from 1676 when it was rebuilt after a fire. It's had Shakespeare and Dickens among its clientele over the years and therein lies the main attraction; it's one of those places where you can step back in time from the bustle of the city.</p> <p>The pub was originally built around three sides of the courtyard and must have looked pretty spectacular. Unfortunately two sides were knocked down in the late 1800s to make way for railway warehouses \u2013 another blow for progress.

It's always packed at the weekend with a nice crowd, and no p*ssed-up punters, which could be due to the fact it's a bit dearer than your average ruby due to it's modern take on regional classics. Good wine-list too, and really helpful, friendly staff. I really can't recommend this place enough...</p> <p>\u2022 119 Brockley Rise, Forest Hill, <a href=\"http://www.babur.info/website/index.php\">babur.info</a>.

Decor-wise it's like any other gastropub with wooden tables and chairs and a general unpretentious feel to it, yet it offers imaginative food at a decent price. Starters range from seared chicken livers, roast onion and black pudding (\u00a35) to oysters (\u00a36) and mains are also varied, my favourite being the salt marsh lamb with curly kale, minted chick pea and cauliflower puree (\u00a315.95).</p> <p>The kitchen is at one end of the room creating a warm and engaging atmosphere, and the service is unobtrusive. By far the best on the menu is the death by chocolate pudding - perhaps shared between two to avoid the death bit. Highly recommended, especially if you happen to be in the Ealing/Chiswick area.</p> <p>\u2022 222 South Ealing Road, +44 208 758 1879, <a href=\"http://www.ealingparktavern.com\">ealingparktavern.com</a>.

It came to us, we didn't go it. </p> <p>During a day of filming down by Roanoke market, two women approached us while we were looking for interviews. They said: \"Are you from the news? There's the news,\" pointing to a bizarre scene unfolding just off the main drag. \"There's a raccoon on the street.\"</p> <p>We took the camera. It was the funniest thing we saw all day, in a day without a lot of fun in it. It went in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/sep/30/roanoke\">video</a>. </p> <p>To a few readers from this area, that became an emblem of patronising outsiders poking fun at hillbillies. To a handful, the only thing worse than showing a raccoon cowering in the drain was the banjo music that accompanied it.</p> <p>\"Everyone does not own a guitar,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/29/younge.america.roanoke.virginia\">wrote Linda Sims</a>, who left Roanoke a few years ago, \"although there are many good musicians in the area and all over south-west VA.\"</p> <p>And then there was \"deminva\", who said: \"This area, although proud of its musical heritage, is much more diverse than the twanging, backwoods image this implies.\"</p> <p>\"Could you please at least try to show that there are people in Roanoke other than hot dog eatin', banjo pickin', bible thumpin' raccoon hunters?\" Christopher Franklin - who clearly knows the area well - asked.</p> <p>At a bar and restaurant late on Saturday night, I was approached by a big guy who recognised me from the video and who may have had too much to drink.</p> <p>\"George,\" he said. \"You're the guy doing that video about how we're all rednecks.\" </p> <p>He particularly took issue with my comment that \"there is nothing remarkable about Roanoke\". The fact that, in the very next sentence, I said: \"It's just like anywhere else. That's why we're here. It's an average American town,\" had clearly passed him by.</p> <p>These are by no means majority views. As a foreign correspondent, I'm usually long gone by the time my pieces run and so don't face the consequences. </p> <p>I've been here a week now and still feel I can hold my head up high in the Texas Tavern. I have long since come to terms with the fact that, just as I will write what I like, people will read into it whatever they like. </p> <p>But these comments are interesting, raise important issues and - given that I'm planning to be here for a while - I thought I might address them.</p> <p>So first things first. Journalists do have a responsibility to avoid caricature and stereotypes (although I wonder how many of these Democratic readers would have complained if I had gone to Alaska and done a piece on clueless beauty queens).</p> <p>They have to balance that with the responsibility to tell the truth, be interesting and be fair.</p> <p>That's not always as easy as it sounds. We are looking for the most interesting quotes, the most arresting moments and the most engaging characters. </p> <p>By their nature, they are not always the most representative - but when the story is told in the whole, you'd hope to do a place, issue or person some kind of imperfect justice. </p> <p>When you're dealing with places or people that receive either little or bad coverage, that responsibility should weigh particularly heavily. </p> <p>Few people write about the Caribbean, where my parents are from, other than if they're writing about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2001/nov/17/caribbean.guardiansaturdaytravelsection3\">holidays</a>. </p> <p>When they do, they usually feel compelled to mention laidback people smoking spliffs, horny rastas and reggae. It's annoying, and speaks far more about what they are looking for than what they might see if they were slightly more curious. </p> <p>Similarly, I have seen journalists report on black British attitudes to fatherhood entirely from a McDonald's in Brixton. It's lazy and, in terms of feeding popular misconceptions, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/1999/mar/01/1\">quite dangerous</a>.</p> <p>But none of that means you won't find black British people in McDonald's, or that reggae, horny rastas and spliff smokers are absent from the Caribbean.</p> <p>In the words of the black intellectual and civil rights activist, WEB Dubois: \"Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasised that we are denying that we ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways, we are being hemmed in.\"</p> <p>It's also true that no two people in the Caribbean, black Britain, or anywhere else will have the same view about a place. Instead, they will have their own sense of what <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,238190,00.html\">makes it authentic</a>.</p> <p>Which brings us back to Roanoke and that pesky raccoon. Reporting from a town's main square, the place where you are most likely to bump into people, seems a fairly reasonable way to introduce a place in a four-minute video. </p> <p>If I stood there every day for the next three weeks, it would be a problem. But for one day - and particularly the first day - it makes sense. Or at least it does to me.</p> <p>The anxiety about being caricatured is a perfectly legitimate one, particularly in a city that's this size and rarely receives international attention (there are Finns here but that's a subject for a whole different posting). </p> <p>I can't say it won't happen, because I'm still finding out about the place. All you can every do is try and hope that people will look at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/youngeamerica\">body of work on this page</a> rather than a single piece.</p> <p>But the desire to proscribe portrayals, portraits and situations that you don't like or that don't chime with your own experience is no less a problem. </p> <p>The same is true of dismissing an outsider's view on the grounds that it came from outside.</p> <p>So Ralph Berrier, if you don't think this is a former railroad town, take it up with the local historian and everyone else here who has described it as such. </p> <p>Just because a town still has a lot of railroad employees in it, that doesn't make it a railroad town. If it did, New York and Chicago would be railroad towns.</p> <p>Linda Sims, if it's your view that everyone here doesn't own a guitar, take it up with the guy in the Fret Mill Guitar Company store. I was quoting him (I don't think he was talking literally, either). </p> <p>He's from here, just like you. And he sells guitars, which I'm guessing you don't.</p> <p>I don't doubt that musical tastes in the area are more diverse than twanging banjos. But down at the harvest festival on Saturday, they weren't playing gangsta rap, R&amp;B or techno. They were playing bluegrass.</p> <p>And the next time I see a raccoon in the street, I promise to look the other way - it wouldn't be funny second time around, anyway. </p> <p>In the meantime, here are another few clich\u00e9s that turn out to be true. </p> <p>People here are really very friendly and have made me incredibly welcome. My next post will relate my night out shooting a glock with a charming conservative voter in Boones Mill, Franklin county (I have to learn to defend myself in case I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama1\">meet another enraged Nader voter</a>).</p> <p>Oh, and since there will apparently never be a good time, now seems as apt a moment as any to show a video of two guys playing bluegrass. One of them has a banjo. </p> <p>It's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/nov/03/arts.highereducation1\">not my kind of music</a>. But I think they're pretty good.</p>",
  "<p>The Icelandic government this morning seized control of Landsbanki, the second-largest bank in the country, and sought to secure a \u20ac4bn loan from Russia as it worked to avert a financial meltdown.</p> <p>The government moved quickly to use sweeping powers over the country's banks granted in the Reykjavik parliament last night. The board of directors at Landsbanki has been dismissed and the bank put into receivership. The government has also loaned \u20ac500m to Kaupthing, the biggest bank in Iceland.</p> <p>UK savers trying to access their Landsbanki-run Icesave accounts this morning were faced with a message telling them the bank was unable to process requests for deposits or withdrawals. Icesave offered competitive rates and has more than 200,000 accounts in the UK. The first \u20ac22,000 (roughly \u00a317,000) held in the accounts is secured under an Icelandic compensation scheme, and the remainder up to \u00a350,000 is guaranteed by the British government.</p> <p>On state radio, commerce and banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson sought to reassure people in Iceland that the bank would remain open and continue to run as normal.</p> <p>The Landsbanki chairman and a large shareholder in the bank is Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, the owner of West Ham United football club.</p> <p>In an address broadcast on Icelandic television last night, prime minister Geir Haarde announced plans to rush through the emergency bill, supported by opposition parties, allowing the government to push through mergers between the battered banks or force them into bankruptcy.<br>\"We were faced with the real possibility that the national economy would be sucked into the global banking swell and end in national bankruptcy,\" he said.</p> <p>There was some confusion about whether the loan from Russia had been agreed. Iceland's central bank said in a statement that it had been informed by the Russian ambassador that Iceland would be given a \u20ac4bn loan and that it had been agreed by the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin. The bank said Haarde had approached the Russians about a loan some months ago.</p> <p>But the Russian state news agency separately quoted the deputy finance minister, Dmitry Pankin, as saying there had been no formal approach from Iceland and that no decision had been made. The Icelandic bank then updated its statement to say that negotiations would begin \"in the next few days\".</p> <p>The Icelandic Financial Services Authority said it had taken control of Landsbanki to \"guarantee a functioning domestic banking system\".</p> <p>The fate of Iceland, which has extensive interests in the UK, is seen as a warning for the rest of the world, after a long boom fuelled by debt, a dependence on its banking industry and a buoyant housing market.</p> <p>Time appeared to be running out for Iceland to deliver a solution to the financial crisis yesterday as its currency, the krona, slumped 30% against the euro, accelerating a decline that has been taking place over the past year.</p> <p>The emergency bill would also allow the government to take over housing loans held by the banks.</p> <p>The Icelandic government now has control of two of the biggest three banks in the country \u2014 the only one remaining in private hands is Kaupthing.</p> <p>Last week, Landsbanki sold the bulk of its international operations, including the London-based Landsbanki Securities, the former Teather &amp; Greenwood, to smaller rival Straumur-Burdaras, to try to bolster its capital base. But with the wholesale markets closing down, banks are finding it difficult to raise the short-term funding necessary for their day-to-day operations, especially when there is nervousness about an institution's stability.</p> <p>Kaupthing and Straumur-Burdaras said in a statement this morning that they continued to operate as normal and had no indication that the government intended to intervene.</p> <p>The financial regulator yesterday suspended shares in Iceland's main banks to prevent panic selling. The government also followed Ireland and Germany by guaranteeing all domestic deposits in Icelandic savings accounts.</p> <p>Concerns about the Icelandic economy grew stronger last week after the government seized control of the third-largest bank, Glitnir, taking a 75% stake in return for \u20ac600m (\u00a3466m). Haarde warned Icelanders at the time of \"the inevitable cut in living standards\" to come.</p> <p>The falling currency, which closed at a record low of 230 Icelandic krona to the euro, is worsening the crisis for the banks, which are shouldering large overseas debts, and for many thousands of individuals in Iceland who were encouraged to take out loans in foreign currencies.</p> <p>In Iceland, there is widespread fear. Sigridur Dogg Audunsdottir, a local government worker in Reykjavik said everyone in the country was \"holding their breath\". Yesterday, she withdrew cash from the bank all the way to her overdraft limit to make sure her family had enough to live on. \"It is just unimaginable. It is so dark and gloomy, we have never experienced anything like this. I took out my money just to be safe, because I felt I had to do something. We've all been living ahead of ourselves, so in many ways this was inevitable. People here have been so obsessed with money. Iceland is like a nouveau riche country.</p> <p>\"I am not blaming the people. The problem seems to be oversized banks in a small economy. We trusted the banks and they encouraged us to borrow money.\"</p> <p>A collapse in Iceland would severely dent confidence in the broader financial markets. But it could also affect Britain, with the main banks funding a string of companies and entrepreneurs, including Robert Tchenguiz, a large investor in Sainsbury's, chef Gordon Ramsay and property tycoons the Candy brothers.</p> <p>One of Iceland's biggest companies, Baugur, has stakes in a swath of the British high street, including House of Fraser, Karen Millen, Oasis and Whittard of Chelsea. One of the biggest credit insurance firms has stopped covering suppliers to Baugur-controlled stores. In a statement over the weekend, it reiterated that most of the funding of its businesses comes from international banks and that it has little exposure to the disaster-struck Icelandic economy.</p> <p>Haarde is said to have approached other Nordic governments to see if their central banks might be prepared to inject liquidity into the Icelandic system. Haarde said the banks had agreed at the weekend to sell some overseas assets and bring the cash back to Iceland.</p> <p>The country's pension funds, which have assets of \u20ac12bn, are also being encouraged to repatriate cash.<br>Kaupthing holds deposits for thousands of UK savers through its Kaupthing Edge account. Kaupthing Edge is covered by the UK government guarantee on deposits up to \u00a350,000. A spokeswoman for Kaupthing said there had been no rush to close accounts.</p> <p>Richard Portes, an expert on Iceland at the London Business School, said the government had made a mistake by nationalising Glitnir, creating fear in the markets instead of just providing it with liquidity.<br>\"You have the same law of unintended consequences that you had in the case of Lehman Brothers,\" he said. \"The Iceland problem was immediately vastly exaggerated.\"</p> <p>He said the Icelandic banks had been unfairly targeted. \"The world is a little unjust. They don't hold any toxic papers. The assets they will have to sell are perfectly good assets. They have been prudently managed and haven't been excessively dependent on the wholesale money markets compared to anyone else,\" he said.</p> <p>Iceland has undergone a remarkable transformation in the past couple of decades, from an economy largely based on fishing to one of the richest in Europe, driven by its biggest banks after deregulation of the banking system. The banks grew rapidly on borrowing and have assets eight times Iceland's GDP. But the party has come to an end, with the krona losing more than half its value against the euro in the past 12 months, inflation at 12% and interest rates at 15.5%.</p>",

  "<p>Since being nominated as John McCain's vice-president, <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> has reiterated what has become a consistent theme for her in this campaign: because of the birth of her son, Trig, with Down syndrome, four months ago, she would be an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090902519.html\">advocate for children with disabilities</a>.</p> <p>But Palin has not offered an agenda for special needs children.</p> <p>Palin first rolled out her disability appeal to great applause <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/sarah_palins_address_to_the_rn.html\">at the Republican National Convention</a> when she said: \"To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters. I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House.\"</p> <p>During <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/vice-presidential-debate.html\">last week's debate with Joe Biden</a>, when asked what areas she would focus on as vice-president, she again raised the issue of children with disabilities. \"John McCain and I have had good conversations about where I would lead with his agenda,\" Palin said. \"That is energy independence in America and reform of government over all, and then working with families of children with special needs. That's near and dear to my heart also.\"</p> <p>But what does that really mean? Advocates for people with disabilities can point to plenty of areas where they see a need for greater government support: healthcare, special education, protection from discrimination in the workplace. But Palin has neither championed these issues in the past nor made specific pledges to address them now.</p> <p>Jim Dickson, vice-president for government affairs of the <a href=\"http://www.aapd-dc.org/\">American Association of People with Disabilities</a> (AAPD), says he has \"mixed feelings\", about Palin's highlighting of disability issues in her convention speech. \"I was very moved by what she said,\" said Dickson. \"But Trig is only four months old. She doesn't know what she's in for. She has no prior record in terms of her mayor's role or governor's role on disability issues. Nothing stands out.\"</p> <p>For instance, the <a href=\"http://www.newamerica.net/programs/education_policy/federal_education_budget_project/idea\">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a>, the federal law that mandates equal educational opportunity for children with disabilities, has been consistently under-funded since its passage in 1975, according to education experts. But the McCain campaign does not propose any increase in overall federal education funding. And his <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/read.aspx?guid=2ca6f926-4564-4301-87cd-a5f35e68c0d4\">bullet point plan</a> makes no mention of special education. Obama calls for fully funding IDEA as part of his <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/DisabilityPlanFactSheet.pdf\">eight-page disability platform</a> (pdf).</p> <p>In general, disability rights advocates give both campaigns high marks for unprecedented outreach to the disability community. For the first time, both have staffers dedicated to cultivating the disability vote, and both have pledged to appoint a White House staffer to focus on disability issues.</p> <p>The one issue where there is a major distinction, and disability advocates side with Obama, is the Community Choice Act. That bill, proposed by senator Tom Harkin and <a href=\"http://obama.senate.gov/press/080115-statement_of_se_14/\">co-sponsored by Obama</a>, would make government funds for institutional care available for home-based services so that more disabled people could remain in their homes. McCain <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/07/AR2008070701672_5.html\">opposes the bill</a> because of concerns about cost. Palin, meanwhile, has come under fire for <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/10/03/palin-protector-children-vs-her-record\">not supporting a bill that would have expanded children's health insurance</a> in Alaska.</p> <p>This does not mean that the McCain-Palin ticket has a desultory record on disability issues. Though Palin lays claim to the issue, McCain is actually the half of the ticket with a record of leadership on disability rights. McCain was an original co-sponsor of the landmark anti-discrimination law, the <a href=\"http://www.ada.gov/\">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA). Dickson also praised McCain for having supported legislation to open voting accessibility to people with disabilities. McCain and Obama <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25865260/\">both supported</a> the <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/6018785.html\">ADA Amendment Act</a>, a bipartisan bill that just passed Congress, which will help clarify the protections in the ADA.</p> <p>There are plenty of ways, from IDEA funding to expanded health coverage to Community Choice, that Palin could promise to serve the interests of people with disabilities. But so far Palin's pledge to lead on disability issues because of her personal connection to the community has not been developed into more than mere rhetoric. And unless she specifies what exactly she would do for disabled children as vice-president, she risks creating the impression that all she is really seeking with that rhetoric is political reward.</p>",

A good doctor takes the patient's pulse, temperature, listens to heartbeat, looks for symptoms of problems and asks questions about diet, lifestyle, history and environment. Many of the distressed companies have been on a diet of toxic debts, off balance sheet accounting, dubious asset values and questionable business models. Yet the auditors did not notice any of the red flags.</p> <p>Auditors continue to act as advisers to the companies that they audit. They are hired and remunerated by the very organisations that they are supposed to be auditing. The auditor's dependence for fees on corporate barons makes it impossible for them to be independent. Their understanding of the businesses that they audited must also be doubted. The auditing industry has consistently failed to provide value for money.</p> <p>No doubt the auditors would point out that that all of the above audits<br>complied with all extant auditing standards. That, if anything, further<br>confirms the poverty of the present auditing requirements. By all accounts the current auditing model is broken and cannot be repaired. This was also evident from audit failures at Maxwell, Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), Enron, WorldCom and numerous other scandals. Yet successive governments have always given in to the well-oiled accounting lobby, which prefers feather-duster audits and fat fees. The only effective way forward is for the regulators to take direct responsibility for auditing banks and financial institutions.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government must set a 2050 target of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">cutting all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80%</a>, according to its own climate watchdog.</p> <p>Lord Turner, chair of the independent Climate Change Committee, said the power sector must almost totally decarbonise by 2030 to achieve this 2050 target.</p> <p>Politicians, business leaders, scientists and campaigners alike have welcomed the report, but the electricity producers called the target \"ambitious\" and stressed the need for a new generation of nuclear power plants. </p> <p><strong>Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society</strong></p> <p>\"The government set up the Climate Change Committee to get sound, independent advice. Now it is imperative that it heeds it. If we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we must make serious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>\"The UK can show real leadership on tackling climate change and a key part of this is investing in low carbon technologies. The first step should be to only grant approval for new coal fired power stations on the basis that they will have their operating permits withdrawn unless they are capturing 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. That would also give the UK a head start in developing a green energy technology with huge economic potential.\"</p> <p><strong> Steve Webb, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman</strong></p> <p>\"There is now no excuse for either the government or the Conservative party not to back the Liberal Democrats' amendment to the bill, which calls for 80% cuts by 2050.</p> <p>\"Once a tough target is in place, the rest of government policy must follow suit. It is no good having a target if the rest of government is pointing in the opposite direction.</p> <p>\"Unrestricted airport expansion, new coal-fired power stations and a massive road-building programme will all pump up emissions and are totally incompatible with this new target.</p> <p>\"The test of the new Climate Change department will not be whether it has a trendy new logo, but whether it has the clout to stop other cabinet ministers undermining these vital climate change goals.\"</p> <p><strong>Spokeswoman, Association of Electricity Producers</strong></p> <p>\"It is important that all sectors are engaged in emission reductions and we are pleased that the Climate Change Committee recognises this. By 2030, the power sector is expected to reduce its emissions significantly, but total decarbonisation, as suggested by Lord Turner in his interview, is an ambitious goal.</p> <p>\"Electricity companies are already investing heavily in low-carbon technologies: 5% of the UK's electricity is currently generated by renewables. That is a fast-growing sector. Nuclear power, which at present accounts for around 20% of electricity production, will also be important. If we want to maintain a high level of security of supply and become greener, we will need to look at all technologies, including carbon capture and storage.\"</p> <p><strong>Dr Neil Bentley, CBI director of business environment</strong></p> <p>\"Raising the target to 80% will increase the challenge to business, but we believe that UK firms will continue to rise to this challenge. We agree with the committee's assessment that such a major emissions reduction can be achieved at a manageable cost, but only if the right policies are put in place.\"</p> <p><strong> John Sauven, Greenpeace executive director </strong></p> <p>\"If we are to almost totally decarbonise our electricity sector in the next 20 years, as Turner suggests, then the new climate minister Ed Miliband must focus on cutting-edge renewables, energy efficiency and super-efficient combined heat and power plants. It can be done, but we'll know if this government is serious when they announce whether Heathrow expansion and a new coal plant at Kingsnorth will get the green light.<br>\"A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that a new fleet of coal plants would hole the new target below the water line, while Labour's current ambitions for aviation expansion would finish it off.\"</p> <p><strong>David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK</strong></p> <p>\"We are delighted that the Committee accepts that emissions from aviation and shipping - the fastest growing sectors - must be included in any credible target.</p> <p>\"However, it is crucial that the UK shows true leadership by demonstrating a commitment to deliver a low-carbon economy - through delivering the bulk of emissions reductions in the UK rather than relying excessively on imported carbon credits.\"</p> <p><strong>Greg Clark, the Conservative party shadow climate change secretary</strong></p> <p>\"I am delighted that Lord Turner has brought forward his recommendations which create a more logical framework for further debate about the Climate Change Bill. We have made it clear that the recommendations of the climate change committee will shape the policies pursed by a Conservative government. Meeting an 80% reduction target would present major challenges especially given the government's poor performance in recent years. However, with the right policies, there would be clear economic benefits from ensuring that Britain plays a leading role in creating a greener and safer world.\" </p> <p><strong>Professor Roger Kemp, Lancaster University, and Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering</strong></p> <p>This target \"will be a challenge greater than fighting both the banking crisis and the \"war on terror\" at the same time. And it will go on for decades.</p> <p>\"The engineering challenge is huge but possible, the political challenge will require a level of courage not seen in the present crisis. The government's policy that developing the new [power] stations should be left to the markets is just not plausible \u2013 particularly with the banking crash soaking up available funds. If part-nationalisation of banks is considered acceptable, why not at least the same level of state financial guarantees to kick-start the low-carbon energy business?\"</p> <p><strong>Philip Wolfe, Renewable Energy Association</strong></p> <p>\"The vital test of UK commitment to combating climate change is what government does with renewables and energy efficiency right now. We have less than 10 years left to start bringing emissions down if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. We therefore look to the new Department for Energy and Climate Change to back the Renewable Energy Tariff measure in the Energy Bill over the next few weeks. If this is done it will empower everyday people and businesses all over the UK to invest in renewable and significantly contribute to the carbon dioxide cut.\"</p> <p><strong>Andy Atkins, executive director Friends of the Earth</strong></p> <p>\"The committee's advice is fantastic news. If we are to play our part in avoiding a climate catastrophe, the new climate law must require future governments to slash UK emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050.</p> <p>\"The climate change law is a trail-blazing piece of legislation \u2013 but the Government must now strengthen the Bill to help make Britain a world leader in developing a low carbon economy.</p> <p>\"But we cannot afford to ignore pollution from international aviation and shipping \u2013 that would be like going on a calorie-controlled diet and ignoring the calories from chocolate bars. The Bill currently has a loophole allowing future Government to continue to ignore these emissions - ministers must act to close it.\"</p> <p><strong>Phil Bloomer, Oxfam's director of campaigns and policy</strong></p> <p>\"This report supports what we have been saying for some time. The government must tackle climate change with the same urgency it is showing in confronting the global financial crisis. </p> <p>\"Current economic problems cannot be used as an excuse for inaction. Without action now, the devastating impacts of climate change will dwarf today's economic difficulties, especially for poor people in developing countries, who are being hit first and hardest.\" </p> <p><strong>Merlin Hyman, director of the Environmental Industries Commission</strong></p> <p>\"We welcome the committee's focus on energy efficiency and believe that a step change in the way we use energy in the UK is the cheapest and most effective way of meeting the targets. We urgently need, therefore, a range of policies for securing energy savings right across the economy that are as equally ambitious as today's recommendations.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>The latest in our series of classic reports come from this week in October 1991. Wales were co-hosting the Rugby World Cup, and consequently went into it with a tentative optimism. But that was shattered when they were beaten 16-13 in their first game by the unfancied and underrated Western Samoa. It was the first time a non-seed had beaten a seed at the World Cup. It was a numbing defeat for Wales, not least because it meant they would effectively have to beat Australia to have a chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals. They didn't. Relive a famous Sunday afternoon in Cardiff with reports from first Robert Armstrong and then Frank Keating below.</strong></p> <p><strong>Exuberant Pacific islanders leave Welsh hopes adrift</strong></p> <p>Western Samoa produced the first major upset of the World Cup with a historic victory over Wales at the Arms Park yesterday. It was the first time a seeded nation had lost to a non-seed in the competition and the first Wales defeat at the hands of the underrated Samoans.</p> <p>Their early success gives the hard-tackling Western Samoa an excellent chance of reaching the quarter-finals, in which they could come up against Scotland at Murrayfield. First, though, the Pacific islanders have to play Australia and Argentina, and next Sunday's encounter with the Pumas appears to offer the Samoans their best prospect of progress to the knock-out stage.</p> <p>Unfortunately Patrick Robin, the French referee, exercised a crucial influence on the result, awarding Western Samoa a try early in the second half after Robert Jones had beaten the centre Vaega to the touchdown. The television action-replay showed the Wales scrum-half succeeded in getting his left hand to the ball a split second ahead of the Samoan.</p> <p>The controversial try came at a critical moment with the scores level at 33, each side having kicked a penalty before the break. There can be no doubt that Monsieur Robin's ill-construed decision presented the Samoans with a winning initiative that they never relinquished.</p> <p>It was a monumental error by an official who did much to destroy the game as a spectacle by his fussy and pedantic use of the whistle. He was at least 15 yards behind the action when Vaega claimed his try, and overall he showed a marked reluctance to make intelligent use of the advantage law.</p> <p>\"I was three yards away and I clearly saw Robert put his hand on the ball first,\" said the Wales captain, Ieuan Evans. \"The referee was way back on the 22.\"</p> <p>If Wales are beaten by Argentina at the Arms Park on Wednesday they will not only be out of the World Cup but will also have to pre-qualify for the 1995 competition. It is not the first time they have lost to a non-International Board nation - Romania won at the Arms Park in 1988 - but yesterday's setback is probably the nadir of their recent ill fortune.</p> <p>Naturally the Samoans were ecstatic. Bryan Williams, their manager, who used to play on the wing for the All Blacks, said: \"It is a great milestone for our rugby and we hope more IB nations will visit our country after the World Cup is over. We would be over the moon if we reached the last eight: that would give us a place in the rugby sun.\"</p> <p>These rugby-mad islanders illustrated the substantial gulf in physical conditioning this tournament has already exposed between the northern and southern hemispheres. The Welsh were quite unable to impose themselves in terms of strength or pace, apart from a period in the final quarter when they became desperate for points.</p> <p>As Wales found when they toured New Zealand three years ago, injuries proliferated largely because they did not have the requisite body hardness to withstand fierce though legitimate contact with the Samoans. The lock Phil May dislocated his shoulder and Richie Collins and Tony Clement were also forced to retire with severe shoulder bruising. All will receive specialist treatment at a Brecon unit today.</p> <p>Mark Ring, who had a knee operation a fortnight ago, was short of pace and match fitness, but midway through the first half he levelled the scores with a short penalty goal after the scrum-half Vaea had kicked an angled penalty. Vaea's conversion of the disputed try restored the Samoans' lead to 93 and, in the 51st minute, it was increased when Vaifale took a short pass from the prop, Fatialofa, to plunge over on the right. At that stage Wales had only 14 men, Collins having gone off.</p> <p>To their credit the Welsh did not lack heart and they raised the tempo. In the 63rd minute Emyr crashed through two defenders for a fine converted try on the left. Two minutes from time Ring set Evans free on the right for a crisp touchdown.</p> <p>Sadly it was not enough. Minutes earlier the sure-footed Vaea had landed a magnificent penalty from 30 metres that put the game out of Wales's reach. The Samoans were just a bit too good - and Monsieur Robin was certainly no redbreast.</p> <p><strong>Splattered by tackling in the fear of God</strong><br> At least Wales did not, as they have done so often in recent matches, just curl up and die. That is not how one reacts when run over by a bus or, on this occasion, 15 double-deckers. Then, splattered is the only word for it.</p> <p>In its long history the Arms Park cannot have witnessed such a sustained and devastating display of tackling. Time and again ball-carrying Welshmen at full pelt were clobbered amidships and thundered back a yard or more.</p> <p>And when they had the ball, the Samoans were putting their heads down and doing roughly the same to any Welsh would-be tackler before they were collared by a desperate weight of numbers.</p> <p>\"We warned Wales about their tackling,\" said a New Zealand follower afterwards. \"We told them it would be like a martial arts battlefield out there.\"</p> <p>The combative, kamikaze rigour of the tackling yesterday made one quail at the thought of what it will be like by the time rugby's World Cup gets into the next century.</p> <p>Some sixth sense must have inspired the Welsh management, weeks ago, to book the whole squad into the Penoyre Rehabilitation Centre for Sports Injuries near Brecon today. Some will be booking in for bed and several breakfasts, poor Wales. By the end even smugly smiling Englishmen in the crowd were wincing for the Welsh.</p> <p>The Samoan captain and prop Peter Fatialofa, at 19 stone, is built like a four-square brick Bethesda Chapel. Afterwards he was as righteous and certain as a fire-and-brimstone sermon. \"This game is all about physical confrontation,\" he said. \"Tackling hard is second nature to us.\"</p> <p>They used to call the Samoans rugby's head-hunters. \"Now we've gone from head to waist. Our tackling is legitimate, legal and has always been a crucial factor of our game. We commit ourselves immensely hard to tackling but there is no cheating about it.\"</p> <p>Another Samoan, sadness momentarily overcoming his jubilation, said: \"We are so sorry to have done it to Wales. They have made us so welcome here. We would much rather have done it to England.\" He would not elaborate.</p> <p>But at Pontypool on Wednesday they can do the next best thing when they take a tilt at Australia.</p> <p>Neither Australia nor New Zealand have deigned to play an international against their island neighbours. It is almost a rugby apartheid for, although Western Samoa were the South Pacific champions in 1987, they were still snubbed at the inaugural World Cup which was patronisingly deemed \"by invitation only\".</p> <p>That still rankles and on Wednesday there is little doubt that more than a few rankles will be reverberating round the hills at Pontypool. That will be for adults only.</p> <p>\"Very few rugby-playing countries have visited us in our history,\" says Fatialofa. \"Hopefully, after today's result, many more teams will come to play us.\"</p> <p>Want to bet? The Catholic Marist missionaries introduced the game to the islands in 1914 and one of the good Marist Brothers' doctrines is a proper and reverent appreciation of the full meaning of 'the fear of God'. Amen to that.</p> <p>When the dust has settled, the bones and bruises been nursed and the humiliation been drunk away, some in Wales might be relieved, for their health's sake, to be playing a few qualifying internationals against Belgium, Sweden and Tunisia.</p>",
  "<p>If Ed Miliband, secretary of state at the new Department for Energy and Climate Change, fails to take radical action to decarbonise the UK's economy, it's not for lack of good, expert advice. Taking pride of place on his desk this morning must be <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">the letter from Adair (Lord) Turner</a>, chairman of the Climate Change Committee, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">makes an unarguable case</a> for deep and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, built on sound science and economics.<br> The 60% <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/10/carbonemissions\">emissions reductions target</a> contained in the Climate bill is not good enough, it says. We need a cut of at least 80% cut by 2050, and this target \"should apply to the sum of all sectors of the UK economy, including international aviation and shipping\". Moreover, the cut can be achieved affordably, costing the UK just 1-2% of GDP in 2050. Given uncertainties about fossil fuel prices, this estimate \u2013 in line with Nicholas Stern's projections in <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">his famous Review</a> \u2013 is close to saying that there will be no cost at all. In the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/06/climatechange.carbonemissions\">event of high fuel prices and supply constraints</a>, decarbonising the UK's economy will almost certainly yield net economic benefits as it ends our dependence on fossil energy.<br> One important reason for tightening the target is that the committee has grasped an important truth. As temperatures rise, non-linear effects will come into play that will amplify warming, such as methane release from permafrost and oceans. Beyond a threshold level, these runaway warming processes are likely to become uncontrollable, and lead to further irreversible impacts, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheets. \"The world may be able to adapt to small changes in temperature change,\" writes Lord Turner, \"but once higher increases are experienced damages will exceed the adaptive capacity of many biological, physical and social systems.\" Thus, it is essential to steer well clear of a 4C temperature rise, which would lead to \"extreme consequences potentially beyond our ability to adapt\", and \"limit the central expectation of global temperature rise to, or close to, 2C\". Taking into account the larger than anticipated role of greenhouse gases other than CO2 \u2013 such as methane and the HFC gases used as refrigerants \u2013 and the need for the UK as a wealthy and highly polluting country to lead on emissions reductions, the UK's proper share of emissions reductions comes to at least 80%, within a global emissions reduction of 50-60%. My only objection to the committee's interim advice is that while it is making all the right arguments, it does not go far enough. We are already experiencing positive feedbacks in the climate system with our present degree of warming of barely 1C, notably with the Arctic summer ice melt. The idea that a 2C temperature rise is in any way safe is more wishful thinking than science \u2013 for all the reasons set out by Turner about the non-linear climate response to emissions. There is now a growing awareness that we should achieve global emissions neutrality by 2050 \u2013 that is, that all residual greenhouse gas emissions taking place by that date should be balanced by CO2 uptake in soils, forests and oceans.  But the committee's advice has to be welcomed, nonetheless. It spells out the actions we should be taking: the systematic decarbonisation of the entire UK economy, including power generation, transport, heating and industry, with a strong reliance on technological innovation backed by public investment and regulation \u2013 and the urgency of embarking on that path without delay. Gordon Brown has already indicated that he will accept the target, and Ed Miliband has been left with little wiggle-room \u2013 just supposing he wants it. The target must now be made law in the forthcoming Climate Act \u2013 but most importantly, it must be backed up by action. As we know from the government's failure to meet its legally binding target on fuel poverty, to pass a law is one thing, to fulfill the obligation is another. The real challenge is for the future. </p> <p>Ed, for all our sakes, don't flunk it!</p>",
  "<p>Japan's most powerful gangsters are mugging up on legal terminology in an attempt to skirt strict new laws that make them liable for crimes committed by their henchmen.</p> <p>The country's top three crime syndicates are believed to have hired former prosecutors to teach them the finer points of the law, which was introduced after the assassination of the mayor of Nagasaki, Iccho Ito, by a gangster last April.</p> <p>Media reports said the legal change has unsettled senior members of the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's biggest underworld organisation, who could now be sued or imprisoned for a range of crimes committed by their underlings, from embezzlement to refusing to pay for a hamburger.</p> <p>Two other major gangs, the Inagawa-kai and Sumiyoshi-kai, have also summoned experts to explain the law and identify loopholes, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said.</p> <p>The Yamaguchi-gumi, whose 40,000 members make up about half Japan's entire gangster population, has reportedly ordered its operatives \"not to cause problems for members of the main clan through illegal activities\".</p> <p>The Asahi said police officials had obtained documents distributed at the study meetings that could have only been drawn up by lawyers.</p> <p>The new law claimed an early success in August when a gangster from a Yamaguchi-gumi affiliate was arrested for refusing to pay the bill at a hamburger restaurant in Kyoto. He only agreed to pay after the restaurant's owner, aware of the legal changes, threatened to charge his boss for the meal.</p> <p>Most top gangsters are also afraid of being sued by the victims of crimes committed by their juniors. \"This fear has made them go quiet recently, as they know they can be sued for damages,\" a source close to the yakuza told the Guardian.</p> <p>Legal experts are reportedly being paid generous fees for talking yakuza leaders through the law and identifying loopholes, which include producing retroactive letters of expulsion to prove that a suspect was no longer a member of a gang at the time he allegedly committed a crime.</p> <p>Lawyers are said to be coaching gangsters on how to conduct themselves during police questioning so as to avoid arrest.</p> <p>The legal revisions are also designed to end the practice of rewarding members of the yakuza after they have served their prison sentences.<br>Compensation for jail time will probably now be paid in cash rather than by bank transfer. In addition, stricter penalties for gun ownership are expected to herald the reappearance of hitmen armed with razor-sharp katana swords rather than pistols.</p> <p>Public tolerance of underworld crimes has waned following a series of lethal shootings, some of which have involved non-yakuza victims. A month after Ito's assassination, a former gangster wounded his son and daughter and shot dead a policeman before taking his own wife hostage at their home in Nagoya.</p> <p>This summer, residents of Kurume in western Japan sought court help to evict a yakuza gang from a local apartment block, saying the ever-present threat of violence infringed on their constitutional right to live in peace.</p> <p>\"The cozy relationship between the police and the yakuza is coming to an end,\" the source said. \"No one really cared when they whacked each other, but when they started to kill civilians, people decided they'd had enough.\"</p>",
  "<p>The culture secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\">Andy Burnham</a>, has backed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/07/premierleague\">Sepp Blatter's call for tighter rules</a> on club ownership and insists it is vital to restore \"confidence\" among supporters.</p> <p>The Fifa president appeared before MEPs at the European Union yesterday when he claimed investment in football was \"out of control\". Blatter asked for help from Europe's lawmakers to draw up more stringent regulations governing who is permitted to seize control of clubs. Burnham backed that plea this morning, and challenged the Football Association to take the lead in tightening up rules for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>.</p> <p>\"We need a strong and reformed FA who is responsible from grass roots level to the England team,\" Burnham said. \"They are the people who need to regulate the game in the interests of everybody.\"</p> <p>Already this season, fans of Newcastle United and Manchester City have been left to deal with the after-effects of takeovers which have turned sour. </p> <p>\"It is important that the supporters know what the person's intentions are for that club and they understand the traditions and the issues around the wider health of the game,\" Burnham added. \"That's why I've said there should be a single, strengthened fit-and-proper-persons test applied before someone takes over. But it should be applied before they take over the club, not after the event as it is at the moment.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, Blatter blasted the super-rich investors willing to buy and part with clubs \"like you would sell a shirt\", citing the example of former City owner Thaksin Shinawatra, who sold up to Abu Dhabi United Group amid allegations of corruption in his homeland, Thailand.</p> <p>\"We have to be alarmed,\" Blatter said. \"We have one prime minister from Thailand going back to his country and he sells his club like you would sell a shirt. Something is very badly wrong here. I don't know how it can be stopped, but there is always a danger that these people will just one day leave.</p> <p>\"You get people turning up with banker's guarantees who are not interested in football and then they lose interest in the clubs and leave,\" Blatter continued. \"What happens to the clubs then? We are facing now investment in football, particularly the Premier League, that is out of control. English football is attractive to investors - it is a phenomenon of the era. The economic power of football is immense.\"</p> <p>Blatter called on EU lawmakers to work with world football's governing body to draw up plans that would make it tougher for unscrupulous money men to make their profits and run.</p> <p>\"We must ask ourselves about what motivates these owners and are they really interested in the game or just making money?\" he said. \"There must be better control of football's finances especially in the difficult climate we are facing. I urge Uefa to work with the EU to tighten up the rules, otherwise there will be big financial difficulties in the future.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Los Angeles man who was beset with financial worries after having trouble finding work has shot dead his wife, three children and mother-in-law before turning the gun on himself.</p> <p>Karthik Rajaram, a father of three, is thought to have carried out the killings sometime after 6pm on Saturday in the family's home in a gated community in Porter Ranch, a Los Angeles police spokesman said. </p> <p>Michael Moore, the LA deputy police chief, described it as \"a very tragic scene, total devastation inside this home.'' </p> <p>\"Inside the home, officers discovered six bodies, all belonging to the family that lived at this location,'' he said.</p> <p>Rajaram, who had an MBA in finance, was a former employee of major accounting firms but had been unemployed for several months. He left three letters in the home detailing his financial difficulties, police said. </p> <p>\"The source of it appears to be a financial state, a crisis if you will, that this man became embroiled in, that has unfolded over the past weeks,\" Moore said.</p> <p>\"We believe that he had become despondent over financial dealings and the financial situation of his household and that this murder-suicide event is a direct result of that.''</p> <p>Officers found the bodies on Monday morning after the wife failed to show up at a neighbour's home to go to work as a pharmacy bookmaker. </p> <p>Rajaram's body was found with a handgun \"in his grasp.''</p> <p>Later, Moore described it as \"this is a perfect American family behind me that has absolutely been destroyed, apparently because of a man who just got stuck in a rabbit hole, if you will, of absolute despair, somehow working his way into believing this to be an acceptable exit,'' he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It is critical to step up and realise we are in some pretty troubling times.'' </p> <p>The gated community, called Sorrento Pointe, is among a number of developments along cul-de-sacs on the foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains in Porter Ranch, about 23 miles north-west of downtown.</p> <p>\"It's very quiet here,\" said Ryan Ransdell, who lives across the street. \"That's what's so shocking about this... You'd think someone would have heard it. You can hear a car door shut at night.\"</p>",
  "<p>At first I was inclined to view yesterday's publicity stunt by the UK Youth Parliament as nothing more than a case of boisterous adolescence \u2013 amusing, immature but essentially harmless. Courtesy of the UKYP, members of parliament returning to Westminster after the summer break found that coins in their change had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/06/tuitionfees.studentfinance\">covered with a sticker</a> bearing the motto \"free for all\". Fees for first degrees at English universities currently stand at a maximum of \u00a33,145. The UKYP wants these fees abolished. Its national campaign co-ordinator, James Greenhalgh, made no bones about it: \"Education should be free for all young people and we will not stop until the injustices this flawed tuition fees system have created are brought to an end.\"</p> <p>Well of course education isn't free. Someone has to pay for it. I suspect that what Greenhalgh actually meant was that, whoever does pay, students \u2013 graduates, that is, because the fees are in fact charged in arrears, after graduation \u2013 should not be among the payers. </p> <p>There is universal agreement that our universities are chronically underfunded. But if students \u2013 graduates \u2013 are not to contribute towards bridging this funding gap, who is? Employers? Hardly, I would have thought, in the current economic climate. Ask any factory worker, or sales assistant, whether they would be willing to see a rise in the prices charged for their products in order to fund the tuition fees of university students, and you could predict what the robust answer would be. The government could pay. This means the taxpayer \u2013 you and me. I know of no mainstream political party, in England, that would dare propose an increase in taxation for this purpose. And if the government \u2013 any government \u2013 does manage to find some spare cash that it is prepared to earmark for education, I would much rather it went towards secondary education than into the universities. </p> <p>The institution of \"top-up fees\" by the Blair government in 2004 (taking effect in 2006-7) was admittedly deeply unpopular. The bill to permit universities to charge such fees scraped through in the Commons by only five votes. But even the National Union of Students now accepts that graduates should make some contribution towards the cost of their higher education. The debate has moved on. What the UKYP's stunt has done is to trivialise a very necessary new phase in this important national dialogue. </p> <p>Two questions seem to me crucial as this debate gets under way \u2013 as it must since the legislation of 2004 will expire in two years' time. First, should the \"cap\" of \u00a33,145 remain as it is, be raised (and, if so, to what new level?) or abolished altogether? Second, irrespective of the arithmetic, what help should be afforded to students in meeting their fees' obligation?</p> <p>I know of few university managers who seriously believe that the cap should not be raised. A straw telephone poll I conducted among colleagues and former colleagues in UK higher education some two years ago suggested that there might be broad support for raising the cap to around \u00a36,000 \u2013 though some, even then, wanted the cap set at twice that figure. Interestingly, there are currently operating in the UK a small number of wholly private HE providers, and such providers do (as the Treasury is well aware) manage to attract UK students \u2013 by no means from exclusively wealthy backgrounds \u2013 who are demonstrably willing to pay anywhere between \u00a316,000 and \u00a321,000 in total for the tuition element of a fully-accredited UK bachelor's degree, taught wholly in the UK, though perhaps over two years rather than three.</p> <p>The current cap might be removed altogether. This need not result in the market-driven nightmare that some doomsayers predict, provided my second question is addressed satisfactorily. </p> <p>The current UK student loans' system is in a mess. Official figures just released on the initiative of the Liberal Democrats show that one in three graduates is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/06/studentfinance.education\">not repaying her or his student loan</a>. A major reason for this seems to be that the RPI element, when added to the loan each year, makes its repayment, for some, an impossible hurdle to jump. What is needed is a completely reformed, comprehensive system of loans and grants that will make a university education affordable for those who want and need it.</p> <p>Which brings me to my final point. There are a great many professions, paying excellent salaries, for which a university education \u2013 however desirable in the abstract \u2013 is not actually relevant or necessary. Substantially raising or abolishing the cap would compel many young people to ask the gut question: do I really need, now, to spend a lot of money or acquire a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/05/student.debt.advice\">great deal of debt</a> studying for a bachelor's degree? </p> <p>I wonder if the Youth Parliament has the maturity to address the debate in these terms?</p>",
  "<p>A computer programmer working at Yahoo's Indian facility was the spin-doctor of India's most-wanted Islamic terrorist orgainsation, Islamic Mujahideen, police said today.</p> <p>The group has claimed responsibility for coordinated bomb blasts in three Indian cities this summer, which killed more than 120 people.</p> <p>Investigators say Mohammed Mansoor Asghar Peerbhoy, 31, was the head of a \"media terror cell\" which comprised of \"highly qualified, computer-savvy people belonging to good and educated families\" who had drafted emails sent just before or just after blasts in Delhi, Ahmedabad in Gujarat, and Jaipur in Rajasthan.</p> <p>Peerbhoy, who police said speaks \"good English\", works with Yahoo as a principal software engineer and takes home 1.9m rupees a year<br>(\u00a322,600). He lives in Pune, a city known for its IT companies in western India, and visited the US for work several times without arousing any suspicion.</p> <p>His story makes for an unlikely terror suspect: his father built a<br>business as a wholesale fruit supplier to the Indian army. One of his brothers is a doctor in the UK, while another is an architect. </p> <p>According to the Hindu newspaper, Peerbhoy \"radicalised himself\" after a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2004. Other reports say he was \"groomed\" by Islamists after taking Arabic lessons.</p> <p>However, in a series of interviews with local media, Peerbhoy's family said he had been falsely implicated - calling his arrest an attempt to \"defame the Muslim community\".</p> <p>Speaking to the Times of India, one of the family members, who refused to be identified, said, \"We don't how he has been targeted and implicated in the case. We know that he will not do anything wrong\u2026. Mohammed is a highly qualified person and we are a very respectable family.\"</p> <p>Mumbai police arrested 15 men who they claim planned to bomb the city during the current holiday season. Peerbhoy's role \u2013 along with two other software engineers - is alleged to have been hacking into unsecured wireless internet sites in Mumbai to send emails that spoke of \"blowing apart your tourism structure\u2026 and demolishing your (Hindu) faith in the dirty mud\".</p> <p>However, many are beginning to suspect that a rash of announcements about \"Islamist masterminds\" have more to do with political pressures than justice. \"The conviction rate is less than 5% in these so-called cases,\" said Tarun Tejpal of Tehelka magazine.</p> <p>\"We simply ask where is the evidence in these cases? What I think is<br>happening is that we have a 24-hour hysterical media which forces<br>politicians and police to act or to show they are acting.\"</p> <p>Mumbai police had originally said that a man called Subhan Qureshi,<br>also known as Tauqeer, was the most wanted man in the country for<br>sending the emails. Yesterday, Rakesh Maria, the joint commissioner of Mumbai police, said Tauqeer was a \"media creation\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, Yahoo's public relations manager did not respond to emails sent by the Guardian today.

After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/sep/25/lostinausten4\">Lost in Austen</a> \u2013 which I would happily have watched six parts of as opposed to a rather rushed four \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/Drama/contemporary/TheChildren/default.html\">The Children</a>, there was <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/Drama/copsandcrime/APlaceofExecution/default.html\">Place of Execution</a>, which concluded last night. As you'd expect from a drama written by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/ukmovies/interviews/britsinhollywood/patrick_harbinson.shtml\">Patrick Harbinson</a> (Law &amp; Order: SVU), directed by <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/the-state-within/lizzie-mickery-daniel-percival-interview/\">Daniel Percival</a> (The State Within) and starring Juliet Stevenson, Lee Ingleby and a smashing supporting cast, it was superior stuff. It all went a bit crackers in the last episode but it was gripping to the end and is hopefully a sign that ITV drama under Laura Mackie and Sally Haynes has finally found its feet. As a strategy, luring back the drama audience that deserted ITV1 with three-parters and shorter runs before offering them six-part series makes a lot of sense.</p> <p>In other, deeply dispiriting but strangely not surprising, news, BBC3 has axed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/02/bbc.television1\">Pulling</a>, a decision that will persuade no one that Danny \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io0rpsKpDYA\">Phoo Action</a>\" Cohen isn't a moron. I suppose that without Pulling around, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b007l3p0\">Coming of Age</a> won't look quite as atrocious but is that really reason enough to axe one of the finest comedies on TV? I suppose if there ever was a third series of <a href=\"http://www.gavinandstacey.com/\">Gavin and Stacey</a>, Cohen would pass on that too because \"every recommission means one less space for a new project\". You can only hope that one of Janice Hadlow's first decisions as controller of BBC2 would be to offer a home to Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly's marvellous comedy. Good knows it doesn't have anything remotely funny of its own at the moment. Unless you count Jonathan Harvey's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGYgSif36ic\">Beautiful People</a>. Which I don't. </p> <p>What else? I notice there seemed to be a lot of phoning of parents on Saturday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/oct/06/thexfactor.realitytv\">X-Factor</a>. That would have nothing to do with the sponsors of the show, would it? I wonder: does it count as product placement if it's a generic thing like a mobile rather than a specific brand of phone? Answers on a postcard. And isn't Tina Fey marvellous as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkZnJsz1FRk&amp;feature=related\">Sarah Palin</a>? I HEART her. (Tina, not Sarah. Definitely not Sarah). When, pray tell, will Five get around to scheduling the second series of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkdRfbN6eew\">30 Rock</a>?</p>",

  "<p>Government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/page/2007/dec/10/1\">reshuffles</a> are strange affairs. No matter how well you've performed in your ministerial job, judged on any objective criteria, you need to keep your metaphorical bag packed in anticipation of the dreaded phone call.</p> <p>Ivan Lewis's bag had been packed for some time. The care services minister had pushed his luck that bit too far in candid comments on the direction of the Brown government. In the end, even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/24/social.care.ivan.lewis\">public backing from the health secretary, Alan Johnson</a>, wasn't enough to save him.</p> <p>So Lewis departs for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/internationalaidanddevelopment\">international development</a>. It's another junior ministerial post \u2013 his fourth, which must be some sort of record \u2013 but at least it's not the sack. The joke will be that he has special responsibility for Siberia; in fact, he's likely to be seeing a good deal of Africa.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/socialcare\">social care</a> sector will miss him. By common consent, he has been the sector's best Labour minister and in the top three of all those appointed by both Labour and the Conservatives. Steeped in social care \u2013 he was volunteering with learning disabled people at age 14 \u2013 he has done a huge amount to raise its profile in the past two years. Whoever would have thought we would today be talking about social care setting the pace for personalisation of services across government?</p> <p>In a barnstorming performance at a fringe meeting at the recent Labour party conference, Lewis spoke of the social care transformation agenda as \"arguably the biggest redistribution of power from the state to the citizen that we have ever seen\". The rhetoric prompted indulgent smiles, but if personal budgets take off as planned over the next three years, who's to say he's not right?</p> <p>The silver lining of the cloud of Lewis's removal is that the care services job, which includes mental health, gets an overdue uplift to minister-of-state status. He will draw some satisfaction from this and from the fact that that the post has gone to a good friend, Phil Hope, who like him has a strong background in the voluntary sector \u2013 if not necessarily in social care.</p> <p>But it makes you wonder about our system of government that a minister who enjoys what he is doing, is popular with stakeholders and, above all, is palpably very good at the task, can be tossed aside so lightly. In any other walk of life, the boss would be up before an employment tribunal.</p>",
  "<p>The jeep slowly ambled its way through the busy bazaar, people running out of the way to avoid its wrath. A policeman jumps out, grabs some clothes displayed outside a shop, chucks them in the back of the jeep, and angrily reprimands the shopkeeper. The vehicle moves on, with a loudspeaker remonstrating other shopkeepers. I explain to my fellow backpackers that the police constantly ask shopkeepers not to put their wares on the street, so that any suspicious packages can be more easily identified. If they don't comply the police confiscate their goods as punishment.</p> <p>You could call this part of the Indian police force's anti-terrorism strategy. Paharganj market, where many foreign backpackers stay because of cheap and clean rooms, is opposite the main New Delhi <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXPvRefzCxg\">railway station</a>. A few weeks ago a series of small <a href=\"http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Explosion-rocks-Karol-Bagh-CP-in-Delhi-many-injured/361040/\">bombs went off</a> less than a mile away at Connaught Place. </p> <p>India is on edge, with some commentators worried that more communal violence between Hindus and Muslims might break out here as tensions rise. There is much talk about establishing a US-style department of homeland security and there has been media frustration over the lack of any serious headway by the police and intelligence services on terrorism generally.</p> <p>In some ways, the always troubled relationship between India's majority Hindu (81%) and second largest minority (11%) Muslim population has become better. For a start there is no longer a continual standoff with Pakistan \u2013 always used by Hindu nationalists to raise doubts about the patriotism of Indian Muslims. Combined with this, Indian Muslims are firmly established in popular culture (through Bollywood, cricket, television soaps) to no longer warrant widespread suspicion. Third, Indians themselves have been very proactive in building community links and trying to reduce tensions every time a religious riot breaks out or a bomb goes off. Last year after the multiple terrorist attacks on Mumbai's local trains, many popular Muslims across the city made loud appeals for their co-religionists to donate blood at hospitals and contribute towards rescue activities. These may be symbolic gestures but they matter and they have an impact.</p> <p>But in many ways India's reputation as a relatively successful multicultural state is being undermined. Recent terrorist attacks have mostly been attributed to Indian-born Muslims, a change from the days when fingers immediately pointed towards Pakistan every time something went off. Pakistan has its own problems, as the Marriott Hotel bomb in Islamabad attested, thanks to the very groups its intelligence agency fostered as a way to undermine India.</p> <p>And then there are the Hindu fundamentalists. There has been growing anger about Hindu fundamentalists attacking Christians in the state of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7644191.stm\">Orissa</a> and more recently Karnataka because the former allege that Christian missionary groups are forcibly converting low caste Hindus to Christianity. There is no evidence of course, except some patchy stories that missionary groups offer health facilities and other benefits to members of congregations. For hardline Hindu groups such as the VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) and its even more fanatical subsidiary Bajrang Dal \u2013 this is a valid enough excuse to attack Christians, destroy churches and intimidate politicians. </p> <p>These Hindu nationalist groups are also hated by Sikhs, who accuse them of trying to control Sikh politicians and their affairs, and by Muslims, who saw them play a major part during the anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002.</p> <p>But the matter is getting out of hand. An increasing number of police investigations have recently found Bajrang Dal activists with weapons and bombs, and even fake Muslim gear. <a href=\" http://outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20081006&amp;fname=Cover+Story&amp;sid=4\"> Many point out the obvious</a> \u2013 that Bajrang Dal terrorists are trying to implicate Indian Muslims when attacking Muslim targets. And yet the Indian government is strangely reticent in targeting these Hindu fanatics with the same gusto it parades suspected Muslim terrorists.</p> <p>There's also no doubt that hardline Muslim groups want to use terrorism as a way of separating Hindus and Muslims, and there seems to be no real strategy or intelligence in dealing with the problem.</p> <p>Thus it's difficult to predict which way the wind will blow. In 2002, after the anti-Muslim pogroms in Gujarat, Hindu fanatics were openly claiming that the state was the start of a nationwide campaign. And yet their attempts to fan similar violence elsewhere failed and the Hindu nationalist BJP government lost the subsequent election because it didn't pay enough attention to poverty. Whatever the experts say, this country is too large and too complicated to predict. </p> <p>But unless something is done to quell rising Hindu fundamentalism, which also fans Muslim, Christian and Sikh grievances, then the Bajrang Dal could end up as India's Taliban. There's an old saying here \u2013 don't ever feed milk to a snake, sooner or later it will bite you.</p>",

So there he was, sporting a nasty cut on the back of his head, as he put in a typically combative man-of-the-match performance to earn his side a 1-0 win in the northern derby, with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yKL8T8rpII\">Jacques Abardonado's own-goal</a> proving the winner. </p> <p>\"Florent's response was exceptional,\" said the Lille president Michel Seydoux. Balmont's friend Sebastien Roudet explained: \"He wanted to play to turn the page and that result would have brought him some calm after one hell of a day.\" Balmont is not the first footballing victim of such a crime in the region: Christophe Landrin was at Lille when he was car-jacked, while Valenciennes's Ga\u00ebl Danic had two cars nicked last summer.

In that respect, he is a modern-day Cantona-Lite. \"His technique and reading of the game are as good as Michel Platini's,\" said Albert Emon, the coach in his one season at Marseille. \"He's still the best ball player in France.\" Pagis' contract is up at the end of the season, and he is undecided about playing on.</p> <p>Lyon went into the game five points clear and claimed that the defeat changes little. \"<a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=23\">We're still top of the table</a> and it's not serious,\" said the captain Juninho, who started on the bench but insisted that Claude Puel's rotation system \u2014 which meant Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m played at left-back and Kader Keita struggled in his first start of the season \u2014 was not causing problems. \"Everyone needs to have a game and others need to rest.\"</p> <p>Pagis admitted that Puel's decision to switch from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2 gave him more room in front of the centre-backs. \"It's rare to have that much time to control the ball and set it up to shoot,\" he said of his <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6z5s2_rennes-30-lyon-pagis-hat-trick_sport\">wonderful third goal</a>. Karim Benzema summed up the mood, saying: \"We're still in front and I guess everyone will think it's good for the title race.\"</p> <p>That much is true, especially as the five teams behind Lyon all won.

The Caen coach Franck Dumas was furious that Plant\u00e9 had stones and batteries thrown at him from the stands. \"We took them to the officials after the game and they asked if he was sure they had come from the stands,\" said Dumas. \"I can tell them now, he didn't have them down his pants when he went out to play.\"<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRweTGtU4BM\"><br>Bordeaux came from behind to beat Lorient 2-1</a>, with <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6iwve_yoann-gourcuff-a-bordeaux_sport \">Yoann Gourcuff man of the match</a> in his first game against the team coached by his father Christian. \"I knew it would be odd to face my dad, but I was happy to be at Lorient as this is my city, where my friends and family are.\" <a href=\"http://www.gourcuffyoann.fr/\">Gourcuff is in a rich vein of form</a> and deserves to keep his place as France's playmaker for the World Cup qualifier against Romania, despite Franck Rib\u00e9ry's return to fitness.

  "<p>Production of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>'s iconic White Rabbit candy has resumed after it was removed from stores worldwide last month following the country's tainted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/25/foodsafety.children\">milk scare</a>, a state newspaper reported today.</p> <p>Production of the vanilla-flavoured candy, which is sold in more than 50 countries, was halted in September when its Shanghai-based manufacturer said the confectionary could have been contaminated by melamine, the industrial chemical that caused the scandal.</p> <p>Chinese officials have accused milk suppliers of adding the chemical, which is high in nitrogen, to certain batches of milk to artificially boost its protein content.</p> <p>Four babies died and more than 54,000 children fell sick from the contamination. As a result, Chinese milk products have been banned by dozens of countries around the world. Senegal was the latest country to impose restrictions, saying yesterday that its ban was a preventative measure.</p> <p>Today's White Rabbit announcement follows a promise made yesterday by China's state council to overhaul its \"chaotic\" dairy industry after acknowledging it suffered from a lack of oversight. The government said it would punish companies and officials who had put profit above people's lives through their involvement in the contamination.</p> <p>White Rabbit's manufacturer, Guan Sheng Yuan Food, said its new batches would undergo government quality testing as checks continue to be carried out on milk products in China. The company has not revealed its new powdered milk source, the China Daily newspaper said.</p> <p>Guan Sheng Yuan's parent company, Bright Foods (Group), had been its main milk supplier for the candy, but tests had shown melamine contamination. The company would not say when White Rabbit candy would go on sale again.</p> <p>The head of China's food quality agency said it was increasing checks on exports to ensure they conformed to the food safety standards of recipient countries, the official Xinhua news agency reported.</p> <p>In mid-September, the agency deployed more than 5,000 inspectors to check dairy factories across the country and monitor the entire production process.</p>",
  "<p>The criminal justice system is in crisis. The police, probation, prisons and the courts are all facing cuts to budgets, increasing workloads, <a href=\"http://www.polfed.org/mediacenter/1B540B1351B3458391E877E08AEF1F0E.asp.asp\">inadequate pay deals</a> and creeping <a href=\"http://www.polfed.org/mediacenter/4EE3BC95E6714042BA3E795A23F8EAE4.asp.asp\">civilisation</a> and privatisation. And all at a time when the police are being dumped more and more with responsibility for resolving the many social and economic problems faced by our communities, particularly the inner cities. Indeed the crisis is so great that all the trade unions and the Police Federation have come together in a campaign which will include a lobby of parliament.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the government <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/crime-statistics/\">claims that crime is falling</a>. But is it? <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/bcs1.html\">The British Crime Survey</a>, which for years was thought to be the most competent barometer of offending rates, and has repeatedly shown falls in crime, could be flawed. My understanding, based on conversations with probation officers over the last 12 months, is that crime in inner city estates and tower blocks is vastly underreported, often because they are<br>impenetrable to researchers.</p> <p>For years, figures have excluded crimes against young people. The official police figures also show a general fall, but the experience of most police officers suggests that the situation is quite different. Crime may well be falling in suburbia, but the situation is much more complex in the inner cities where particular crimes such as robbery and offences of violence appear to be at best static but probably increasing. It appears that those of us who have wealth are increasingly able to provide security for ourselves; those without it are left relatively defenceless.</p> <p>As a result of education budgets being devolved to individual schools, the money left for youth services is virtually zero in some areas. Alongside this, there is a paucity of assistance for those with mental health problems, the homeless and for other at-risk groups, which means that police officers are increasingly the first point of contact with the homeless, the mentally ill, the vulnerable, those involved in antisocial behaviour, drug users, those with alcohol problems, and those involved in domestic violence.</p> <p>Yet the powers of the police to intervene positively in these situations are extremely limited. Because of the government's preoccupation with targets and key performance indicators, intervention cannot be justified unless there is an outcome, in particular arrest and charge. The dilemmas facing the criminal justice system are alarming. Following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/17/ukcrime.ukguns\">murder of Etem Celebi</a>, who I knew personally, in east London last November, I had numerous conversations with local police and youth workers. What they told me was that tension between geographical gangs in the area had never been greater, and the number of children for whom the only solution was now control, containment and eventual incarceration was on the increase.</p> <p>Probation officers who once had caseloads of 30 and knew the individuals personally, now talk of 80, 100, or even more. The response of management to this crisis has been to increase the caseload limit and to advise staff to spend less time with less serious offenders. However time is made available to input endless data into computers to meet the demands for information and monitoring from the Ministry of Justice.</p> <p>The prison population has now reached 93,000 for the UK, an all-time record. In order to cope prison activities cease on Fridays and do not open up again until Monday morning. Rather than engaging in education and skilling for work, prisoners sit watching television screens or are confined to their cells.</p> <p>But there is a way forward which would bring workload relief to everyone in the system, and increase the number of children who can avoid falling into crime.</p> <p>At the moment there is no mandatory duty on local authorities to prevent gun, knife and related crime among the young, and no duty on central government to ensure it is adequately funded. All efforts are left to the voluntary sector, often underfunded, or to progressive local authorities.</p> <p>This is a glaring fault in the system What is needed is a statutory duty on local authorities to provide youth services, to improve the infrastructure of problematic estates, to increase equality of opportunity to education and work, and to provide counselling and family support for individuals in trouble, and for families wherever there is need.</p> <p>I recently drafted a bill which could make this a reality. It would force central government to ensure that local authorities had funds to carry out a range of duties which would be prioritised and delivered locally. Whether those services were delivered by the authority themselves, the voluntary sector or any other providers, including the private sector, would be decided in the locality.</p> <p>Lord Ramsbotham, the former chief inspector of prisons, will be introducing the bill in the House of Lords soon. In effect there would be a move away from the obsession with criminalising behaviour, incarceration and punishment towards health and treatment. This could not happen overnight, but should be planned over the life of two parliaments. At the end of that time there would be massive savings to the justice and health budgets, hundreds of thousands less victims of crime, fewer gangs, fewer individuals reliant on drugs and alcohol as a means of self-medicating, fewer killings and proper services for the vulnerable.</p> <p>Finally, this could be partially funded in the short term by abandoning ID cards, and in the long term by a vast reduction in budgets. This in turn would free up police officers, probation officers, and others to contribute towards the social cohesion that our communities desperately require.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/05/children.socialexclusion\">Last Saturday's rally</a> by the Campaign to End Child Poverty deserved wider coverage than it received. The campaign's work and research findings, <a href=\" http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/news/news/child-poverty-under-the-microscope/23/131\">published last week</a>, are a reminder, for those who needed it, that economic hardship and a widening chasm between rich and poor did not begin with the credit crunch. They go back to before the Blair years. They continued through them and under Gordon Brown.</p> <p>The figures on child poverty on Britain, in the third term and 11th year of a so-called Labour government, returned with majorities beyond the dreams of Harold Wilson, are symptoms of a deep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/brown.economic.policy\">sickness in our society</a>. </p> <p>In my own constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow are some of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7641734.stm\">highest concentrations</a> of child poverty anywhere in the country. There are 23,450 children, 79%, living in poverty. Neighbouring Poplar and Limehouse is not that different. </p> <p>Across Tower Hamlets as a whole in 2007, two-thirds of children were living in \"income-deprived families\" (how Orwellian the language of public policy has become), making it the most deprived borough in England on that measure. </p> <p>The incidence of child poverty is directly linked to lack of work and dependency on benefits. Despite these root causes children, parents, teachers and education officials in Tower Hamlets have done extraordinarily well in raising the level of educational achievement \u2013 a success praised by the End Child Poverty Campaign. </p> <p><a href=\" http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/failure-on-child-poverty-targets-is-moral-disgrace-842780.html\">Responding</a> earlier this year to news that the government was going to miss its target of halving child poverty by 2010, Sir Al Aynsley-Green, England's children's commissioner, said: <br> </p> <blockquote> <p> Poverty is, in our view, the single most pernicious influence that is blighting the lives and prospects of our young people. We are one of the richest countries in the world. Yet Unicef has found that we have some of the highest levels of poverty. Poverty underpins most of the other social issues we are concerned with.</p> </blockquote> <p>We also have the unhappiest children in Europe. Beneath the aggregate statistics lies an ocean of suffering. It is not simply the overall family income that is stunting the lives of children in east London. Housing, health and welfare inequalities are cutting them down at an early age. It is by no means unusual for constituents to turn up to my surgery looking to be rehoused because they are living 12 or 14 to a two-bedroom flat. <br> To repeat \u2013 this was going on throughout 2005 to 2007, and before I became the MP. It was going on while New Labour and their clique were boasting endlessly of the economic bounties they were bestowing on Britain. It was going on while Gordon Brown assured us \u2013 against all experience and contradicting the insights of even sophisticated pro-capitalist economists \u2013 that he had abolished the boom/slump cycle. </p> <p>And through those years the people of east London saw the gleaming spires of finance capital soar higher and higher in the City of London and Canary Wharf, dwarfing the inhabitants in between. The wealth would trickle down sides of the Gherkin and the NatWest Tower, we were assured. Instead, the poorest got swept down the gullies. And now it is going to get a lot worse, quickly. <br> The official anti-poverty strategy for Tower Hamlets cites the 90,000 jobs \"created\" at Canary Wharf as central to progress. But scarcely any of those jobs went to people living in Tower Hamlets. And now, as the empty Lehman Brothers offices bear witness, the question is how many of those jobs are going to go over the next few months.  It is not only Brown and New Labour who stand hopelessly exposed by the turn of events. So too are David Cameron and the Tories. Their call for an end to casino capitalism and for tighter regulation of the finance sector falls into the category of telling the biggest whopper you can think of in the hope that the public will be so stunned they'll doubt their own critical faculties.  This is the same Cameron who says he wants to be as radical in the social field as Margaret Thatcher was in economics. It sounds like a darkly mumbled line from Marlon Brando in the Godfather. I can only imagine that it means something like shutting every social services department and getting rid of red-tape such as legislation guaranteeing children's rights. It was under Thatcher that child poverty doubled. The steps proposed by both parties are hopelessly inadequate. The Liberal Democrats don't even enter the picture thanks to their hapless leader choosing this of all moments to lurch towards the free market \u2013 watch the space between those shoulder blades.  As this financial crisis deepens, people will want radical policies \u2013 more like the New Deal of Roosevelt than Blair's workfare scheme of the same name. Already public ire has turned against the stockbrokers, the hedge-fund managers and the City slickers. </p> <p>It is becoming clearer by the day that an emergency programme of radical anti-poverty and anti-recessionary measures is required. The signal from Brown's reshuffle is that he is going to do exactly the opposite. Who on earth in the Brown circle thinks the Peter Mandelson has traction with Labour people? Putting him in charge of business is a sign that it will be the bankers and the chief executives, and no one else, who get to enjoy a lavish welfare state and economic protection. </p> <p>From the Chicksands Estate and the Roman Road there's a burning resentment at what's been done to this country and its children. A glance at the history of the East End should give the powers that be fair warning: they'd be ill-advised to ignore the suffering lapping at their gates.</p>",
  "<p>Seldom are debates about freedom and equality thrown into such sharp relief as over attitudes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/smoking\">smoking</a>. How should the right to smoke be balanced against the right to health? Is it fair to increase taxes on tobacco, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/07/smoking.health\">so many smokers have low incomes</a>?</p> <p>Public opinion matters more than normal when governments face these dilemmas. In order to justify further curbs or higher taxes, sensible ministers will want to be sure that they are in tune with the public mood. One reason for the success of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6949311.stm\">last year's ban</a> in England on smoking in pubs, restaurants, offices and other enclosed public spaces (following similar bans in Wales and Scotland) is that the public backed it, so few people felt that cherished freedoms were being eroded.</p> <p>What next? Now that adults can enjoy their daily lives without inhaling tobacco smoke, has government policy gone as far as it can go? With the number of smokers down to one in four adults, and still falling, is it now up to individuals to make their own decisions? Or should the government do more to protect children and to help more smokers to overcome their addiction?</p> <p>Earlier this year Action on Smoking and Health (<a href=\"http://www.ash.org.uk/ash_home.htm\">Ash</a>) commissioned <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com/uk/panel/\">YouGov</a> to explore public attitudes in detail, as part of a report on the next steps for tobacco control, <a href=\"http://ash.org.uk/ash_3xe9h0zo.htm\">Beyond Smoking Kills</a>, published today. Our first finding was that support for last year's ban is higher than ever. It had already grown from 51% in 2004, before the legislation was debated, to 72% before the ban took effect. It has now climbed further, to 77%. Even smokers now favour the ban, though by a narrower margin. This matters because a decline in support for existing measures would make it hard to introduce new ones. In fact, YouGov's research suggests that the ban has whetted the public's appetite \u2013 and, indeed, the appetite among many smokers \u2013 for further action.</p> <p>YouGov then tested a range of proposals for new measures to reduce smoking. The most popular is to allow tobacco to be sold only by licensed retailers \u2013 and the licence would be withdrawn from shops found to sell cigarettes to anyone under 18. This is backed by 86% of the public and opposed by just 5% \u2013 to give a net score of plus-81. Among smokers the figure is also strongly positive: plus 59.</p> <p>Other measures popular with smokers and non-smokers alike are: making it easier for smokers to get hold of nicotine replacement products, such as patches and gum (general public: plus 77; smokers plus 71); and cracking down on smuggling (plus 68; plus 29). This is easier to advocate than implement; but these figures would suggest that spending more to tackle this problem would be popular.</p> <p>One of our most striking findings is that as many as 77% of the public would support a ban on smoking in cars carrying children under 18. Only 11% oppose this. For the great majority of people, the health of children outweighs the freedom of adults to do what they want in their own private space. Even among smokers, supporters of a ban outnumber opponents by almost two-to-one (48% support, 27% oppose).</p> <p>As a young journalist in the 1970s I recall covering the fierce debate over whether the wearing of seatbelts should be compulsory. The \"freedom\" lobby lost that battle and, more recently, we have had restrictions on the use of mobile phones by drivers. Now we find overwhelming support for further curbs on what we can do in our cars \u2013 only this time the cause, children's health, has nothing to do with road safety. </p> <p>One of the few measures that divides smokers from non-smokers is attitudes to price. Three in four non-smokers would like the price of tobacco to rise faster than inflation. That view is shared by barely one in ten smokers. As non-smokers are in a majority, the view of the overall public is well over two-to-one in favour. But ministers will be wary, for such a price increase would make little or no difference to the daily lives of non-smokers, but harm the living standards of millions of smokers, especially poorer ones. More votes may be lost than gained from what is an ostensibly popular policy, unless the pill is sugared with a commitment to use the extra money to help adults to quit smoking and to encourage kids not to start.</p> <p>Looking at the full range of data about public opinion, including a Citizen's Jury that Ash commissioned in Hackney, I am clear that the public, and even most smokers, favour a tough new strategy. They would back new measures to protect children's health, curb smuggling, stop shops selling cigarettes to the under-18s and help smokers to defeat their addiction. There are hurdles to be overcome; but they are labelled \"cost\" and \"practicality\", and not, in this particular instance, \"freedom\".</p>",
  "<p>By popular demand it is time for a bit of list creation. Over the last few weeks there have been sporadic outbursts of list making, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/verrochio\">Top Five Wire shocking moments</a> or debates over which series was best or which version of Way Down in the Hole was the worst.</p> <p>I thought I would propose a couple of Top Fives myself. And then my colleague <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulowen\">Paul Owen</a> outlines his best ever Wire scenes. And then you can debate those choices. Or ignore them and post your own lists.</p> <h2>Top Five Wire tracks</h2> <p>1. The Body of An American \u2013 The Pogues (wakes in Kavanagh's)<br>2. Way Down in the Hole \u2013 DoMaJe (season four)<br>3. Fast Train \u2013 Solomon Burke<br>4. Sixteen Tons \u2013 The Nighthawks (only bettered by the Redskins version)<br>5.

Yet another polaroid of a police van in a ship container arrives from LA/Miami/wherever<br>3. Herc confides that he walked in on Royce in the act of fellatio (receiving)<br>4. The priest confesses that Sobotka is in competition to pay for the church window<br>5. He pitches for the commissioner's post to Carcetti (and we never thought he would get the job!)</p> <p>Now I didn't like Valchek - he bullied his son-in-law [Prezbo] and he was a mediocre, self-motivated political cop - but his scenes nearly always made me laugh.</p> <p><strong>And now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulowen\">Paul Owen</a>'s Top Five scenes:</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGgRtiCVo2w\">SERIES ONE: Elastic products</a></h2> <p>Poor <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/stringer_bell.shtml\">Stringer Bell</a>. The second-in-command of Avon Barksdale's sprawling drug-dealing operation spent much of the first three series trying to reorganise the business along free-market lines, forming a cartel with other dealers, investing heavily in property, and attempting to abandon the traditional dealing model of gaining territory through violence. But his employees weren't always quite on the same page, to use a corporate cliche he would probably have liked. In this scene, Stringer (Idris Elba) visits one of the Barksdale front companies and finds his young staff's attitude to customer service - \"Man, fuck 'em! Let 'em wait!\" \u2013 more suited to a drug corner than a copy shop. Whereas the heroin these kids are used to selling is an \"inelastic product\", Stringer informs them, meaning the buyers have little choice over what they are sold, users of more \"elastic\" merchandise such as photocopying will go elsewhere if the service or quality is poor. He'll have similar arguments with less enlightened thinkers than himself throughout the series; this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPS9YKGaKQE&amp;NR=1\">admirably civilised boardroom meeting</a> is another good example.</p> <h2>SERIES TWO: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5VGKoWNGYY\">Nick Sobotka meets Prop Joe</a></h2> <p>Series two shifted the focus to dock workers struggling with the collapse of their industry; some of them began to get involved with the dealers we met in series one. Here, well-meaning <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/actors/port/pablo_schreiber.shtml\">Nick Sobotka</a> (Pablo Schreber) attempts to sort out the problems his cousin Ziggy has caused with a mountainous dealer named Proposition Joe (Robert F Chew). Chew gives a great performance, a mixture of sociable, down-home wisdom and quiet menace. Lucky for Sobotka he has Ukrainian drug wholesaler Sergei \u2013 representing an even bigger player \u2013 on his side. \"Fool,\" Prop Joe tells him, \"if it wasn't for Sergei here, you and your cuz both would be cadaverous motherfuckers.\" The scene illustrates the unusual power relationships, wrapped up in race and economics, that played out between the black dealers, the white dockers and the foreign drug importers throughout this series.</p> <h2>SERIES THREE: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtMi52-mWH0\">\"Just a gangster, I suppose \u2026 \"</a></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/avon_barksdale.shtml\">Avon Barksdale</a> (Wood Harris) returned from a stint in prison to find Stringer itching to take his business legit. \"We <em>past</em> that run-and-gun shit, man \u2026 \" Stringer says. \"We could run this goddamn city.\" It almost looks like his message has got through, but then Avon looks up. \"I ain't no suit-wearing businessman like you,\" he tells String. \"I'm just a gangster, I suppose \u2026 And I want my corners.\" The skill of the writing in series three was to make Avon's loyalty to the vicious ways of the street seem almost as worthwhile and honourable as Stringer's attempts to break free. From this moment on there was trouble brewing at the top of the Barksdale empire.</p> <h2>SERIES FOUR: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_ZUsnFevQo\">Ruth's Chris Steak House</a></h2> <p>Series four skipped a generation, introducing us to the teenagers of West Baltimore. Here <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/bunny_colvin.shtml\">Bunny Colvin</a> (Robert Wisdom), the reforming policeman turned reforming teacher, takes a few of his most irredeemable young toughs to a high-class restaurant. The results are awful. They're totally out of their depth, awkward with the staff, suspicious when the hostess wants to take their coats, and mocking of each other when they don't understand what's on the menu or what phrases like \"on special\" mean. And yet the next day in school they show off to the other pupils about where they've been the night before and what a fantastic time they had. The sequence was written and acted with real insight.</p> <h2>SERIES FIVE: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2WyBRwoElM\">\"Remember that one day summer past \u2026 \"</a></h2> <p>The way the characters of the four teenagers introduced in series four were built up was a joy to watch. And none more so than that of <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/michael_lee.shtml\">Michael</a> (Tristan Wilds), the troubled, sensitive youngster gradually drawn deeper into an increasingly violent world. In this scene he says goodbye to his best friend <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/duquan_dukie_weems.shtml\">Dukie</a> (Jermaine Crawford) for the last time. Dukie brings up a memory from the year before, when they were both still relatively innocent and unscathed by the drug trade. \"You remember, Mike?\" he asks, almost begging for a glimpse of the old Michael. But after a long pause Michael, now so hardened and changed by his involvement with brutal drug kingpin Marlo Stanfield, replies simply: \"I don't.\" A heartbreaking moment.</p> <p>Those were my favourites.

  "<h2>What has changed?</h2> <p>From today, if you have a savings or current account with a UK-based institution, up to \u00a350,000 of your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/banking.banks\">cash is protected </a>through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). </p> <p>If the institution collapses you will be entitled to claim back 100% of your money up to that limit.</p> <p>Savers are covered for that sum in each organisation they bank with - unless any of them share a banking licence. If, for example, you have money with Barclays and HSBC, which don't share a licence, you will have up to \u00a350,000 protected in each bank.</p> <p>However, if you have money with HSBC and First Direct, which do share a licence, only the first \u00a350,000 of your total will be protected. Use our guide to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/interactive/2008/sep/25/savings.providers\">check which organisations are linked</a>.</p> <p>The protection is for each account holder, so in a joint account up to \u00a3100,000 will be covered.</p> <h2>What if I have more than \u00a350,000 in an account?</h2> <p>The first \u00a350,000 will be 100% secure and you will be able to reclaim it in the same way as someone who holds less than the new limit. You may be able to recover some of your other money, but only after the bank has been liquidated. The FSA is looking at how this process can be made easier.</p> <h2>How do I get my money back if my bank does fail?</h2> <p>If a bank or building society falls into difficulty the FSCS will swing into action. It will get a list of customers from the administrators and if you are on it you will be sent a form to apply for compensation. You must fill this in and send it back to get your claim processed.</p> <h2>How long will that take?</h2> <p>The FSCS says that so far it has settled 96% of claims from depositors within two weeks, but these have related to credit union failures so there have been far fewer savers involved than if a major bank were to fail. A spokeswoman for the FSCS admits this is \"uncharted waters\" and is unable to say how long claims would take to turn round.</p> <p>In a consultation document published earlier this year the government proposed making it easier for the FSCS to settle claims so that all savers can be compensated within a week. No final decision has been made on these changes.</p> <h2>How many people will benefit from the increased limit?</h2> <p>Anyone who has a savings balance approaching the old limit of \u00a335,000 or holding between \u00a335,000 and \u00a350,000 in a single account stands to benefit from the change - it means they will not have to move their money around to ensure it is 100% protected. </p> <p>According to a Treasury consultation document, last summer 95% of building society accounts and 96% of bank accounts held deposits of \u00a335,000 or less, while 97% and 98% respectively held deposits of \u00a350,000 or less.</p> <p>If those figures are unchanged, around 3.5m accounts which were not completely protected under the old limit are now 100% guaranteed. There would still be a tiny number of people who will not have their deposits protected, but between them they hold almost 40% of the money held in UK savings accounts.</p> <p>However, heightened awareness of the need to spread money around since the Northern Rock crisis means there could be far fewer accounts holding deposits above \u00a335,000. </p> <h2>I have an Icesave savings account. Will my money be protected?</h2> <p>Icesave has been taken over by the Icelandic government, and the Icelandic deposit protection scheme will cover the first \u20ac20,887 (\u00a316,264) of savings. If your account has a balance higher than this, the remainder will be covered by the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to a maximum of \u00a350,000.<br> </p> <h2>What about the Irish savings guarantee, how will that affect me?</h2> <p>UK savers with Ireland's six biggest banks, including those with Post Office savings accounts, do not have to worry about the protection limits that apply to banks and building societies in this country. They will have 100% of their deposits protected under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/30/ireland.banking\">guarantee announced earlier this week by the Irish government</a>.</p> <h2>What if your mortgage and savings are with the same bank?</h2> <p>Your deposits are offset against your outstanding borrowing and you only get back anything that is left after this has been done. So if you hold \u00a330,000 in a savings account and have an outstanding mortgage of \u00a3200,000 when your bank fails, instead of getting any money back you would see your mortgage debt reduced to \u00a3170,000. The FSA is consulting on whether your mortgage and savings should be dealt with separately, but in the meantime you might want to move your savings to another provider.</p> <h2>What else is changing?</h2> <p>Nothing straightaway, but the FSA is looking at ways to improve the scheme and to make payouts quicker. At the moment, for instance, someone with a large amount of money in an account on a temporary basis - for example, the proceeds of a house sale - only has \u00a350,000 covered. The FSA is consulting on the possibility of raising protection for individual savers on a temporary basis.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/itv\">ITV</a> programmes controller, Peter Fincham, has delayed a raft of single dramas scheduled for autumn until winter or next year, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal.</p> <p>Sources said Fincham had delayed at least three single dramas - Sleep With Me, Gun Rush and Caught in a Trap - so ITV can delay spending money on production and marketing and use autumn to build drama series.</p> <p>This means a delay for the drama one-off Caught in a Trap in which Sound of Music star Connie Fisher plays an Elvis Presley-obsessed parking meter attendant who embezzles money from her work to pay for Elvis memorabilia. </p> <p>The drama, filmed this summer for a planned autumn transmission, is loosely based on a real story. It also stars Jim Carter, Geraldine James as her stepmother and Joe Absolom as her would-be boyfriend.</p> <p>A reason for the delay is understood to be financial. ITV does not bear the total cost of a production on its books until it has aired, which often can affect when a show is broadcast. </p> <p>A second ITV single drama that will spend more time on the shelf is Clerkenwell Films' Sleep with Me, adapted by Andrew Davies from the book by 2005 Joanna Briscoe.</p> <p>Filmed last year and tabled for an autumn broadcast, it tells the story of a love triangle between a literary editor on a national newspaper, played by Adrian Lester, his academic wife, played by Jodhi Mary, and an interloper called Sylvie, played by Anamaria Marinca.</p> <p>The third postponed single drama is Gun Rush, a drama about gun crime written by Richard Cottan, directed by Richard Clark and starring Timothy Spall.</p> <p>The drama, which has been filmed by ITV Productions, was scheduled for broadcast in spring, moved to autumn and has been delayed again.</p> <p>Spall plays Doug Becket, a driving instructor who takes the law into his own hands when his daughter is shot dead in a London supermarket.</p> <p>Set against the rising wave of gun crime in Britain, ITV said Gunrush \"explores what it means to be a man in contemporary society\". </p> <p>Sources said that Fincham likes all three dramas but the only one likely to be shown before January is Caught in a Trap, which may form part of ITV's Christmas lineup, according to an ITV source.</p> <p>The network tends to air its big programmes after Christmas, when the BBC traditionally attracts more viewers and when advertisers are less keen to buy airtime.</p> <p>ITV has already had success this season with major multipart dramas The Children and Lost in Austen. It is set to screen the three-part Wired, two-part Lynda La Plante drama Above Suspicion and the two-part romantic drama Mr Eleven.</p> <p>An ITV spokeswoman declined to comment. </p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>When I went to see Taken, the action film starring Liam Neeson, I thought it would be like a Steven Seagal film. More specifically, I thought it would be like Seagal's Under Siege 2. In both films, a man in early middle age has retired from his former life as an ultra-warrior. And in both films, the hero comes out of retirement and becomes the person he always was, and can't shake off \u2013 a man who fights, and climbs, and leaps off bridges, and so on. </p> <p>Of course, I knew there would be differences \u2013 Seagal saves the world while trying to take his daughter on holiday; Neeson saves his daughter after she's been kidnapped while on holiday. Seagal's enemies are Middle Eastern, if I remember, whereas Neeson's are Albanian. Also, Neeson's main antagonist is cruel and ruthless, whereas Seagal's main antagonist, in a memorable performance by Eric Bogosian, is cruel and ruthless but also totally nuts, which makes him slightly less frightening.</p> <p>But the thing I really wondered about was the fact that Neeson, usually a caring, ponderous presence, had become an action star. That's what made me go and see the film. I just wondered what he'd be like.</p> <p>I think he's terrific. First of all, he has no trouble doing the normal action things \u2013 say, jumping off a boat, forward-rolling and then killing somebody. He's great at fight sequences. At one point, he talks his way into a den of Albanian organised criminals, pretending to be a bent cop, and kills all but one of them in a sequence that seems to last about a minute. And the thing is, I can hardly remember any individual kills \u2013 it's a flurry of slamming doors and headlocks. He appears to hit people brutally hard, and it's believable because he's so big.<br> But there's more to this film than just action. At the start, something about it \u2013 something good, that is \u2013 seemed rather familiar. Neeson plays a former secret service warrior who has retired to be near his daughter. The daughter lives with Neeson's horrible, snobby ex, played by Famke Janssen, an ex-Bond girl who seems to be thriving as she approaches middle age (check her out as Ben Kingsley's constantly smoking wife in The Wackness.) </p> <p>Anyway, Janssen has married a rich ponce, and Neeson is being squeezed out of his daughter's life, and it's heartbreaking. The way he stoops, his walk, and the way he uses his eyes is just superb. He's given up being a hero, and now he's being humiliated; the early scenes, which set this all up, are a bit manipulative. But it just about works. And then \u2013 bang! The daughter is kidnapped. Neeson takes control. Suddenly, he's a mad driver, a killing machine, and a detective. His ex-wife's rich ponce of a husband is nowhere. Ha!</p> <p>Of course, what this reminds me of is the first Die Hard film, in which Bruce Willis, who has lost his wife to a rich ponce, ends up saving them. This engages a specific emotion in guys \u2013 it's the \"I'm not rich, or sophisticated, but I'm better than rich ponces\" syndrome. Every guy Bruce, or Liam, kills, is one for the real guys, and one in the eye for metrosexual internet billionaires, or whatever.</p> <p>So I was right to think that Taken would be a bit like a Steven Seagal film. But it's better than that, I think. It's as good as a Bruce Willis film. And that's high praise indeed.</p>"
