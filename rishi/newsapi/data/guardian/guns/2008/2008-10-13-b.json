  "<p>They grew up racing go-karts as though they were dodgems. Now they race 750-horsepower cars with survival cells so strong that you could probably drive one off the rim of the Grand Canyon and live to tell the tale. No wonder today's formula one drivers don't play by the old rules, as those of us who rose before dawn on Sunday saw during the course of an absorbing but, in the end, dismaying telecast from the foothills of Mount Fuji.</p> <p>Manoeuvres that could be politely described as over-aggressive by Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa, rivals for this year's drivers' title, shaped the outcome of the race and provoked the subsequent accusations and recriminations. Both were penalised by the race stewards. Deeper down, however, the real blame lies with those who allowed their predecessors to adapt motor racing's etiquette in order to incorporate the kind of tactics that drivers of earlier eras would have seen as tantamount to attempted murder. </p> <p>There is no difficulty in identifying those predecessors. Ayrton Senna's belief in his own near-divinity and Michael Schumacher's sheer unscrupulousness set an example to Hamilton and Massa as surely as Bach begat Beethoven and C\u00e9zanne begat Picasso. What we are seeing now is the inevitable consequence of kowtowing to the standing they had established in the grand prix circus.</p> <p>There is certainly something of Senna about Hamilton and, sadly, it is not confined to a driving talent that approaches genius. When the Brazilian was once put on the spot over a misdemeanour on the track, he replied: \"But I am Senna.\" Hamilton appears to have acquired a similar sense of bulletproof entitlement, a conviction that goes far beyond the normal boundaries of self-confidence and into a realm where the rest of the human race plays only a supporting role.</p> <p>From what we know of him, Hamilton does not share Senna's propensity for seeing his role in a near-mystical light. He prefers to keep his wheels on the ground, with an attitude more reminiscent of that displayed by Schumacher .during the German's period of total dominance. There are signs that Hamilton inherited from both men the view that any tactic, from the borderline unchivalrous to the downright illegitimate, justifies victory, for the simple reason that, according to their logic, it confirms the natural order of things.</p> <p>When Robert Kubica criticised Hamilton's approach last week, he was probably not expecting to see such instant and vivid evidence in support of his words. \"There are differences of philosophies,\" the Polish driver said. \"Either you drive hard but fair or you are overconfident.\" He went on to make a specific criticism of the English driver's tactics at Monza last month. Hamilton rejected the accusation, but on Sunday his behaviour as he refused to accept the consequences of a poor start showed that Kubica's comments were not merely an example of the usual mind games.</p> <p>While he nurses his hope that the next two races will make him the next British world champion, Hamilton might like to be reminded of how the very first, Mike Hawthorn, won his crown exactly 50 years ago. Three races from the end of the season, Hawthorn was neck and neck with his great rival, Stirling Moss, as they went to the street circuit at Porto. Moss won the first Portuguese grand prix at a canter in his Vanwall, with Hawthorn heading for second place until he span on the last lap and stalled the engine, facing the way he had come. In order to restart his car, Hawthorn had to push it. Under a rule that forbids a car to travel against the direction of the circuit, the stewards promptly disqualified him. Moss, however, stood up before them to say that when Hawthorn had pushed the car, the Ferrari had been on the pavement and therefore not, strictly speaking, on the track. </p> <p>As a result of Moss's testimony, Hawthorn was allowed to keep his second place and the six points which, under the scoring system of the day, went with it. A few weeks later, after races at Monza and in Casablanca, Hawthorn was named champion. He had won the title by a single point from a man who has never, from that day to this, expressed even the tiniest twinge of regret for the action that cost him so dear. Perhaps the difference is this: those men knew that every time they raced, each had the other's life in his hands.</p> <p><strong>Wembley's Pavlovs must stop ringing their bells</strong></p> <p>Probably enough has already been said about the Wembley crowd's response to Ashley Cole's howler on Saturday, but no one seems to have picked out the most hilariously gruesome moment of all, which came shortly after the introduction of David Beckham.</p> <p>Even the former captain cannot have anticipated the fervour with which he was welcomed. His arrival on the pitch was cheered to the rafters, as was every subsequent touch. So when, in the 83rd minute, he hit a perfect crossfield ball which Cole brought under control with a single deft touch, the crowd literally did not know whether to cheer or boo.</p> <p>It was a perfect reflection of the current mood of the England crowd, left in a state of terminal confusion by years of expectations being raised and dashed. The time has come, surely, for a purging of all Wembley's ghastly Pavlovian trigger mechanisms, starting with the public-address announcer ordering the crowd to get behind \"your England team\" and the band playing The Great Escape, that infallible reminder of past travails.</p> <p><strong>Armstrong's influence casts fresh doubts over cycling</strong></p> <p>The Lance Armstrong story, in which a single individual starves an entire sport of oxygen, continues to gather momentum. Now Armstrong has somehow persuaded cycling's governing body, the UCI, to bend its own <br>anti-doping regulations. A cyclist returning after a period of inactivity is supposed to be tested for a period of six months before being allowed to compete in UCI-sanctioned events. Abiding by that rule, however, would not allow the Texan to begin his scheduled preparation for the 2009 Tour de France by taking part in January's Tour Down Under. So an exemption has been granted for a man whose return to the sport has been heralded as an opportunity for him to wipe away the residue of the rumours that surrounded his earlier career. How on earth do they expect us to take them seriously?</p> <p><strong>Cipriani's use of spin paints a depressing self-portrait</strong></p> <p>Stuart Higgins, the former tabloid editor who now handles Danny Cipriani's public relations, informed the media that his client is a serious sort who doesn't indulge in the celebrity life. How, then, do we explain the England fly-half's cover shoot for the Observer's monthly sports magazine, where he was photographed in a 007-like pose, shirt unbuttoned, reclining among half-dressed models? Nothing wrong with that; it's the pretence that stinks. The arrival in sport of such people as Higgins, following on the coat tails of Max Clifford, is unutterably depressing. The only spin in Cipriani's life should be the kind he puts on his passes.</p> <p><strong>Backing Ballesteros to pull off his greatest escape <br></strong></p> <p>What we loved about Severiano Ballesteros was his gift for escapology. No one really cared whether he won or lost. This time around, we care a lot.</p>",
  "<p>Schools and colleges need to help students with learning difficulties feel safer and more secure between lessons, new research has found.</p> <p>While most children look forward to a break between lessons, many pupils with special educational needs (SEN) feel vulnerable and anxious at break times, lunchtimes and while moving between classrooms, researchers found.</p> <p>The study by Cambridge University's Faculty of Education and the <a href=\"http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/\">Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities</a> (FPLD) argues that children with SEN should be given more access to \"safe\" areas, such as libraries, or have access to support, supervision or guided activities outside of lessons.</p> <p>The recommendation is among those made in a new report - <a href=\"http://www.whataboutus.org.uk/\">What about us?</a> \u2013 looking at how to improve the experiences of students with learning difficulties in mainstream education.</p> <p>Government policy is increasingly geared towards teaching students with SEN in mainstream settings, but researchers warned it could lead to problems for young people with learning difficulties if not properly implemented.</p> <p>The research team worked with nine different institutions in three separate parts of the country including mainstream schools, further education colleges, an independent post-16 vocational training college and a special school. </p> <p>SEN students helped the researchers identify problems with their place of study and devise initiatives to tackle them, which boosted their confidence, skills, status and esteem, the researchers said.</p> <p>Many of the SEN students said that they found school life particularly difficult between lessons. Moving around campuses in busy corridors or on staircases was stressful and they felt vulnerable and insecure in playgrounds during breaks.</p> <p>Young people should be given more support and secure or structured activities during break times to solve the problem, the study found.</p> <p>For instance, some of the schools had common rooms offering pupils with learning difficulties somewhere quiet where they could talk to friends.</p> <p>Another offered students access to a learning centre, where they knew they could go for support from familiar and trusted members of staff when needed.</p> <p>Researchers also found that young people with learning difficulties wanted more opportunities to influence the day-to-day running of their school or college through representative bodies such as student councils.</p> <p>The report says it was \"noticeable\" that young people with learning difficulties were not included on these bodies and that in some cases participants in the research did not even know their school or college had a student council.</p> <p>When they were consulted for their views, however, simple obstacles that were affecting their wellbeing \u2013 such as a ramp that was too steep for wheelchairs, or sinks positioned at the wrong height \u2013 were often quickly resolved.</p> <p>Young people also want to be more involved in the planning and decision-making around transitions in their own lives, such as when they move from school to college, or enter the world of work.</p> <p>The report says students often feel anxious about major changes, but were much more confident when visits, \"link courses\" and work placements were laid on to help them move from one institution to another.</p> <p>While the young people believed the government's inclusion policy was a good one, it needs to be translated and put into practice more effectively, said the lead researcher, Richard Byers, Cambridge University lecturer in special and inclusive education.</p> <p>\"Schools are very busy places and are naturally concerned about challenging and developing all their students,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In most of the successful schools and colleges we worked with, however, it was clear that it was entirely possible to drive towards excellence and include young people with learning difficulties at the same time.\"</p> <p>Jill Davies, FPLD's research programme manager, said: \"Hopefully the findings will encourage schools and colleges to get their students with learning difficulties more actively involved in research and development work geared to improving their own experiences of mainstream education.</p> <p>\"Students can provide a very effective check on policy implementation and quality.</p> <p>\"Involving them in this way is good for schools, colleges and policy makers \u2013 as well as being good for the young people themselves.\"</p>",

In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and the sugar until white and soft. Add the egg yolks gradually, one by one, then add the almonds and beat them in. Gently fold in the chocolate with a spoon, then add the bread crumbs, flour and vanilla essence and mix together. </p> <p>In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites, along with a pinch of sugar, until stiff - but do not over-beat. Fold the egg whites into the cake mixture and then pour the mixture into a buttered 26cm cake tin (lined with paper). Place in the oven and cook for one hour.</p> <p>During this time make the icing. Place the cocoa powder and the icing sugar in a mixing bowl. Warm together the butter, sugar and water until dissolved. Add the liquid into the dry mixture and mix together for a thick but 'pourable' consistency. Once the cake has cooked and cooled, pour over the cake.</p> <p><strong>Top tip </strong><br>Always use dark chocolate, as opposed to milk, when cooking and baking because it provides the desired taste and texture for a recipe.</p> <h2>Chocolate cake with raspberry ganache by Alan Coxon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338547650\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/13/Divine_00049-Crop.jpg\" alt=\"Divine chocolate cake\" width=\"140\" height=\"187\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ingredients<br><strong>200g dark 70% chocolate <br>200g unsalted butter cut in pieces<br>125ml strong espresso style coffee<br>85g self-raising flour<br>85g plain flour<br>0.25tsp baking powder <br>200g dark moist muscovado sugar<br>200g golden caster sugar<br>25g coco powder<br>3 medium free range eggs<br>1tsp natural yoghurt <br>4tbsp grated divine dark chocolate to decorate<br>plus butter for greasing</strong></p> <p>Raspberry ganache:<br><strong>200g 70% dark chocolate<br>285ml double cream,<br>2tbsp golden caster sugar<br>150g fresh raspberries</strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0C/gas 3. </p> <p>Butter a 20cm round cake tin (7.5cm deep) and line the base. </p> <p>Break the chocolate into pieces and place into a heatproof bowl and sit on top of a pan half filled with hot water, ensuring that the water does not touch the base of the bowl. Add the butter, the warm coffee and heat everything together gently in the double boiler just until everything is melted taking care not to overheat. (Alternatively place everything in a bowl and melt in the microwave on medium for about four minutes, stirring after two minutes.) </p> <p>While the chocolate is melting, mix the two flours, baking powder, sugars and cocoa in a big bowl, mixing together thoroughly or passing through a large sieve to evenly distribute the ingredients. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and stir in the natural yoghurt. </p> <p>Pour the melted chocolate mixture and the egg mixture into the flour mixture, stirring just until everything is well blended and you have a smooth, quite runny consistency. Do not over-beat or over-handle. Pour this into the tin and tap the tin gently for an even surface and the removal of any air bubbles trapped in the mix.</p> <p>Bake for one-and-a-half hours then check the cake by inserting a skewer in the centre. It should come out clean and the top should feel firm (don't worry if it cracks a little). Leave to cool in the tin (don't worry if it dips slightly), then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. When the cake is cold, cut it horizontally into three.</p> <p>To make the ganache:<br>Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place into a bowl. Place the cream into a pan, add the sugar, heat until it is about to boil, then remove from the heat. Pour the cream over the chocolate and stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the raspberries, breaking them up a little before leaving it to cool slightly. </p> <p>Sandwich the layers together with just a little of the ganache. Pour the rest over the cake, letting it fall down the sides and smoothing to cover with a palette knife. Decorate with grated chocolate. (The cake keeps moist and gooey for three to four days).</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong><br>Whenever melting chocolate, always take care not to overheat as this can damage your recipe.

Remove bowl and leave to cool. </p> <p>Cream the softened butter with the caster sugar in a food mixer or the proper way, with a wooden spoon, until light and white. Gently stir in the cooled chocolate and four egg yolks. Sift the flour, baking powder and cocoa powder into the bowl and then add the grated orange rind. Fold the mix gently together with a metal spoon using big scooping movements. Add the rum, vanilla and water. </p> <p>Whisk 5 egg whites until stiff (don't overwhisk). Add to the mixture by beating in the first tablespoon to loosen the consistency. Then fold the rest in very gently using a metal spoon. Don't worry if it's not perfect, as it can be hard to combine the two. </p> <p>Pour the mix into the tin and put it in the oven for 45-50 minutes (check after 35 \u2013 ovens vary!). To test it, prick with a cocktail stick. It should come out clean. Don't worry if the top of the cake has cracked a bit \u2013 you'll be icing it up. Remove and place on a cooling rack. Take out of the tin after five minutes and leave to cool. Brush the glaze on while still a bit warm. </p> <p>To make the glaze, put the marmalade into a saucepan and melt over a low heat until it's runny. Brush this onto the cooling cake base with a pastry brush. </p> <p>To make the fudge icing: combine the sifted icing sugar and cocoa powder in a bowl. Melt the butter and water and pour into the icing sugar mix. Beat until combined. It should be easily spreadable but not runny, so you might not need all the liquid. Cover the top of the cake and sides generously with the icing, tip it then finish using a spatula. Go for a smooth or a rough finish. You can decorate with cherries, grated chocolate, crumbled flake or chocolate curls (peel from a bar of chocolate with a potato peeler).</p> <p>For the bitter chocolate icing: melt chocolate pieces in a bain marie (as above) with butter and golden syrup. Pour it over the cake for a smooth finish. Let it set. Pipe messages on top or decorate with cherries.

  "<p>When it comes to community cohesion, using the wrong words can cause real harm. Preventing Violent Extremism, the government's pathfinder fund for winning hearts and minds in the Muslim community, is a good example. <br> In March 2007 Brent council and other west London boroughs received \u00a3634,000 from the Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE) fund. The aim was to build \"strong communities, confident in themselves, open to others, and resilient to violent extremism\". However, we encountered problems. The whole point of PVE was to fund moderate Muslim organisations who are trusted by their community and can deliver. But often groups we wanted to work with were reluctant and feared they would lose credibility if they worked under the PVE banner. They said the title connects Muslim people with violent extremism in a way that is unjustified, ignoring the fact the majority are law-abiding citizens. </p> <p>We agree. Associating Islam with this crime in such a crude way puts Muslims in a similar position to the Irish at the height of attacks by the IRA. West London boroughs therefore came up with a new title, Building a Stronger and United West London: Working with Muslim Communities. This is not to say we hid the government's name, but our new title made a positive statement about local Muslim people and our commitment to them. </p> <p>The old name continued to create extra pressures. As one of the groups we worked with put it: \"Hostility to receiving funding through the PVE strand is very high . . . it was only through the trust that the community has in us that we were able to calm fears and suspicion\". </p> <h2>British Muslim or Wot?</h2> <p>So how have we made a success of the pilot, despite these problems? Some west London boroughs have used funding to engage directly with radicalised Muslims. Here in Brent, we focused on people who have yet to go down that route. Some of our projects tackle the issue head on, but others take a roundabout approach. </p> <p>British Muslim or Wot? created a space for Muslim boys and young men to build a new narrative about being young, British and Muslim, using film and drama. Part of this was providing a good understanding of Islam. A charismatic person with a radical interpretation may be very persuasive; giving a good grounding helps these young men make up their own minds. </p> <p>The project also looked at the difference between religion and culture. For example, you may be brought up with strict rules about what women should wear, but these could be cultural rather than religious. Separating culture from religion helped people think how they could be Muslim and British. </p> <p>We also support those who want to stand up to extremism in their community. We have funded a programme to train young women in leadership and communication skills, which helps with personal and career development. Incidentally, it also gives them confidence to confront extremism. </p> <p>The results have been good. Building a Stronger and United West London has been evaluated by the Office of Public Management. It found 13% more young people felt they could \"influence decisions affecting my local area\"; 8% more described their area as \"a place where people from different background get on well together\"; and the number saying attacks and harassment because of race or religion was a problem dropped by 6%. </p> <h2>Looking to the future</h2> <p>Brent council has now received three more years' funding. This is partly because we have a large Muslim community: 12% compared to the 8% of Muslims in London overall. But it is also recognition our approach is working. </p> <p>Our next step is to encourage Muslim communities to develop stronger links with non-Muslim individuals and groups. </p> <p>Brent's police operations superintendent, Mark Goldby says our work has filled a gap: \"Brent isn't a major target for terrorism. But it's clear a lot more could be done in the communities,\" he says. \"We have got to take it all back to basics and stop people getting involved in the first place.\" </p> <p>This is not to say Brent does not need PVE funding. In fact, we probably need more. A number of convicted terrorists have lived in and around the borough, for example the \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid came from Harlesden. Also banned organisation Al Ghuraba is openly recruiting in nearby Hounslow. The far right is seeking to capitalise by putting up stickers depicting Muslim suicide bombers. </p> <p>The organisation behind British Muslim or Wot? put the case for further funding in its final report: \"We found that without an affirmation of identity and a positive sense of self, participants expressed vulnerability and confusion about lifestyles or beliefs. </p> <p>\"Young Muslims have to contend with Islamophobia, social exclusion, negative media reporting and anger over foreign policy. What was most alarming was the extent of internalisation of the cocktail of issues . . . Without any outlets and forums to express themselves they 'bottled up' their feelings. The opportunity to discuss all these sensitive issues with their Muslim peers was a unique and cathartic experience.\" </p> <p>In this context, tact and careful use of language is essential. The government's new national strategy, which picks up the baton from PVE, is called simply the Prevent Strategy. This is a step in the right direction. As superintendent Goldby puts it: \"The moment you use the wrong terminology, people disengage.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Jennifer Crook is head of diversity at Brent council</p>",
  "<p>Poor foreign workers bear the brunt of \"the stark horror\" of Saudi Arabia's secretive death penalty system, Amnesty International said today, with a Saudi citizen up to eight times more likely to escape execution through a \"blood money\" payment than a foreigner.</p> <p>Foreign nationals, mostly Asians and Africans, who face capital trials in the conservative kingdom are frequently unable to understand court proceedings if they are not Arabic speakers, are often not represented by a lawyer and are routinely held for long periods in harsh conditions and coerced into false confessions.</p> <p>\"Poor foreign workers are literally paying with their lives when accused of capital crimes in Saudi Arabia,\" said Amnesty International's UK Director Kate Allen. \"Frequently bamboozled by secretive and unfair trials conducted in a language they don't even understand, they go to their deaths with little assistance from their home countries and little mercy from a grossly unfair Saudi justice system.\"</p> <p>The Saudi authorities do not provide statistics on the use of the death penalty but Amnesty recorded at least 1,695 executions between 1985 and May 2008. Of these, 830 were foreign nationals and 809 Saudis (with the nationality of 56 unknown). Foreigners make up about a quarter of the country's population of 28 million. </p> <p>Executions are currently carried out at an average of more than two per week, most by beheading and many in public. Two beheadings last Sunday brought to 74 the number carried out this year. Last year a record 153 people were executed, compared with 37 in 2006. The previous record, of 113, was in 2000.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia is one of the few states in the world with a high rate of executions for women. It is also one of the few to execute people for crimes they committed when they were still under the age of 18.</p> <p>The kingdom applies a strict version of Sharia law, under which rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can all carry the death penalty. Part of the reason for the rapid rise in executions, Amnesty shows, has been an extension of the use of death penalty in the late 1980s to cover \"corruption on earth\" (sometimes applied to political activities) as well as drugs-related offences.</p> <p>Amnesty found that foreigners are at a severe disadvantage during trials compared to Saudis and lack the cash or the contacts to negotiate pardons via \"diya\" or \"blood money\" arrangements.</p> <p>\"The death penalty is not only applied unfairly and in a secretive manner,\" says Amnesty. \"It is discriminatory and is sued against those who are least able to access their rights. It is little more than a macabre lottery whose consequences, for many, are lethal.\" The report shows that one pardon has been given for every four executions of Saudi nationals compared to just one for every 30 executions of foreign workers. </p> <p>The cases researched included executions for adultery, apostasy and for what was officially described as \"sorcery\" and \"witchcraft\" by an Egyptian man. Most of those executed have been Pakistanis.</p> <p>Six Somalis who were publicly beheaded in 2005 had been arrested in 1999, convicted for robberies and sentenced to five years' imprisonment and flogging. Neither they nor their relatives were aware of their death sentences. The men only discovered that they were to be killed on the morning of their executions.</p>",

Here are rows of bunk beds, neat and ready for the refugees - from what? The insistent sound of rain might provide a clue. This is perhaps some flooded world, a London gripped by an environmental nightmare.</p> <p>Over the bunks soar sculptures, giant pieces that seem strangely familiar but awfully big, as if we humans have shrunk a little. Or maybe they have sprung into life, and, watered like plants, grown larger.</p> <p>Here is Louise Bourgeois' huge spider, Maman, which recently became part of Tate's collection; here is a Bruce Nauman; here is an Alexander Calder; here is a Henry Moore. Touch them and you get a little shock: they are not made from metal, but are enlarged replicas in soft polystyrene. There is something of the film set about this scenario.</p> <p>Scattered on those bunks are paperbacks - HG Wells's The War of the Worlds, JG Ballard's The Drowned World. A huge LED screen shows a montage of sci-fi films from Solaris to Alphaville to The Man Who Fell to Earth. You might take it as appropriate entertainment for the doomed, or simply as background instructional material provided to remind the gallery visitor that we are locked in a dystopian literary conceit. TH.2058, as it is called, is the ninth Unilever Turbine Hall installation, by the 43-year-old French artist Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster. She has plunged us into the future by 50 years and into an immersive scenario on to which visitors can project their own fears and fantasies.</p> <p>Each time this ambitious commission comes around, the stakes are raised. As Tate Modern's director, Vicente Todoli, says, it is \"one of the most successful and anticipated art events in Britain and internationally\". No one thought that Carsten H\u00f6ller's coiling helter-skelters, which two years ago gave gallerygoers a hair-raising funfair ride, would be rivalled in popularity by a jagged crack in the ground. But Doris Salcedo's Shibboleth, the last Turbine Hall installation, became an object of huge fascination and speculation to visitors. Now Gonzalez-Foerster has upped the ante again: by presenting a piece of sci-fi story-telling with theatrical flourish. </p> <p>Is it prediction or fantasy? \"I see it as a fiction,\" said the Strasbourg-born Gonzalez-Foerster, below, who lives partly in Rio de Janeiro. \"It has a dark side, but if you spend time with it, you get the feeling that it's not only dark. It is up to the audience to invent their relationship to the work. It is like a giant editing room.\"</p> <p>The silver lining of her dystopian cloud is, she says, that the work speaks of humans' shared experience. </p> <p>\"It might be dark, the idea that so many people are sleeping together on these bunk beds, but this is our permanent condition, in a way: we have to share a space. This is not an endwork; it allows the possibility that things continue.\" On the interactive nature of the work, she recalled her time as a teenager working as a museum guard. \"I was shocked to see how little time people spent with each artwork. So I have become obsessed with how to keep the viewer a bit longer.\" </p> <p>\u2022 TH.2058 is at Tate Modern from today until April 13, 2009.</p>",
  "<p>'I'm tempted,\" one mother of three says. \"If you want what's best for your children, you bloody do what you can.\" \"A friend of mine did it,\" confides another. \"She was a teacher and they found her out. It was dreadful.\" School's out on a rainy day in Twickenham, west London, and the conversation on the way home turns to cheating. Parents who cheat, that is, by lying about where they live to get their children into the \"right\" school.</p> <p>Here in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, the number of parents found to have provided false addresses on school application forms has mushroomed from five to 50 in the past year. The council says this is because it has been sharing the information it holds on parents across its departments and with neighbouring local authorities, as advised by the information commissioner. And, \"with the best primaries in the world\", it says it has been a victim of its own success. </p> <p>But isn't there more to it? Tens of thousands of parents across the country are visiting potential schools for their children this week. A growing proportion will be working out how, when they are outside their favourite school's catchment area, they can defraud the system and secure their child a place for next year. This will particularly be the case in city schools, where competition is rife and there is at least an appearance of choice.</p> <p>The Local Government Association said this year that council leaders were \"concerned at the worrying trend of increasing numbers of parents willing to break the law\". The LGA had surveyed 31 councils and discovered that 24 had seen a rise in the number of parents who lied on application forms in the past three years.The figures for 2007-08, while still low, were nine times higher than two years ago and nearly three times higher than a year ago. </p> <p>In Coventry, the number of parents found to have attempted to defraud schools had risen from zero to 14 in three years. In Cheshire, it had leapt from zero to 16 and in Bristol from two to eight. Most of those caught had given a false address near a popular school. In parts of Scotland, school application fraud is widespread, too. This autumn, East Renfrewshire council discovered that at least one in 20 applications to its secondary schools was bogus. In a poll of 880 parents, commissioned by insurance firm Sheilas' Wheels, one in seven said they would pretend a relative's address was their own to get their child into the \"right\" school. And one in 12 said they would try to sweet-talk a headteacher to secure a place. The firm has cottoned on to parents' desperation and is offering cover against local authorities denying their children a place at their first-choice school. It will provide a lawyer to parents who have missed out on a place and want to appeal. In fact, parents are entitled to free legal advice from their local authority councillor anyway and do not have to pay for an appeal. </p> <p>Peter Read, a retired head who now advises families in Kent and Medway on school admissions and appeals, believes parents \"appear to be prepared to go the extra yard in an attempt to secure a place at a school which performs well in the league tables or merely boasts a good reputation locally\".</p> <p>So are league tables the real reason behind the jump in the number of some councils' bogus applications? Les Lawrence, chair of the LGA's children and young people board, thinks they have at the very least \"assisted\" the boom. Ministers naming and shaming schools in which fewer than a third of pupils get five good GCSEs has added to some parents' impulse to cheat, he says. Parents today are more versed in what they think a good school is, and they won't settle for anything less.</p> <p>Margaret Tulloch, secretary of the lobbying group for fair school admissions Comprehensive Future, says the government has led parents to believe they have a choice when it comes to school admissions. Often they do not, she says. \"By creating 'choice advisers' to help parents through the school admissions process, parents think they have to pull out all the stops for their children,\" she says. \"This has, no doubt, helped to fuel an increase in fraudulent admissions.\"</p> <p>Read thinks Andrew Adonis, the former minister for schools, is partly culpable. \"I want every parent to be a pushy parent. It is a jolly good thing,\" Adonis said in August. Read says this is tantamount to saying \"do whatever it takes to get a place for your child\".</p> <p>But schools, too, are at fault. Last week the chief adjudicator for schools admissions, Philip Hunter, admitted some schools would have unfairly awarded places to children this year.</p> <p>He told the Guardian half of all school authorities in England were breaching the new admissions code. There had been \"widespread\" failure by schools to remove discriminatory questions about parents' marital and employment status from application forms and to make clearer the definitions in their admissions rules, he said ahead of his report next month on whether schools are complying with the new admissions code. </p> <p>It would be easy to be almost sympathetic to parents who bend the rules a little, if you believe that ministers are egging them on and schools are at it anyway, were it not for the audacious scams they concoct. It's not just the familiar tales of parents who have been caught trying to pass off a rented property as their home or pretend their children live with their grandparents, friends or relations.</p> <p>Now, councils tell Education Guardian, parents are finding \"imaginative\" new ways to deceive. \"One couple lived in a caravan within the catchment area,\" a spokesman from Cheshire county council says. In East Renfrewshire, families are alleged to have forged the council tax documents that a school requested as proof of address. One family even rented a house for a week and decorated the living room to convince visiting officials it was their home.</p> <p>In fact, parents are now so adroit at application fraud, schools and local authorities increasingly discover their deceptions only after their children have started the new term. This puts schools and local authorities in a very sticky situation. The school admissions code states that a school can withdraw a place if it was obtained fraudulently. But, if a school decides to do this it must take into account the length of time a child has been at the school. \"It is only reasonable for an admissions authority to withdraw that offer in very limited circumstances,\" the code says. But what \"reasonable\" is has never been tested.</p> <p>It should be, says Mark Blois, a partner and head of the education team at the law firm Browne Jacobson. He advised a school on what to do when it found a pupil who had been attending for three years was living outside the catchment area. In the end, the school decided against taking the case to the high court and sent the father a letter expressing its strong disappointment in what he had done. Teachers argued that since the pupil had started his GCSE courses, kicking him out would have been too disruptive to his education.</p> <p>\"Some parents are getting to reap the rewards of their deception,\" Blois says. \"There's an enormous emphasis on not penalising the child for something that the parent has done wrong. We need a local authority or school to take this to the high court and test it. The law is far from clear on what schools should do in these circumstances.\" He says it is \"extremely likely\" that there is a rise in cases like this when the number of fraudulent applications is on the rise.</p> <p>Read agrees that schools should make an example of pupils like these to deter parents. \"They should be withdrawn from schools for a term,\" he suggests. \"After all, an innocent family has been deprived of a place at the school because of their actions.\"</p> <p>For now though, sanctions against parents who commit application fraud are minor. In most cases, if the child has yet to start school, the offer of a place is just withdrawn. Parents can then choose to argue the case in front of an independent appeals panel. </p> <p>Councils prefer to deter parents by catching as many culprits as they can. Lawrence says they have started to check parents' addresses earlier, on a more regular basis and work more closely with schools.</p> <p>Some, like Ealing and Poole councils, have spied on families under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act legislation, which was pushed through by the government in 2000 to allow police to carry out surveillance on potential terrorists and organised crime.</p> <p>This is a step too far, says Lawrence. Even so, whatever councils do, he says, they \"almost continuously have to play catch-up\" to what canny parents are up to.</p>",
  "<p>Over the next three months, applicants for 2009 entry into university will be completing their online applications. With drop-down menus, prompts and clear instructions, it's easy to think this is a simple and straightforward task. Many advisers will be familiar with a quick burst of mouse clicking followed by the exultation \"I've finished!\" Without prior research and preparation, though, that frenzied bout of clicking can easily lead to unnecessary trouble and an unhappy experience later.</p> <p>Before embarking on the detail of the online application, do your research. First, work on your choice of subject, then find out which unis do your course, paying particular attention to content and entry requirements. Next, compose your personal statement justifying your choice.</p> <p>Registering online is the easy bit. Go to the Ucas website (<a href=\"http://www.ucas.ac.uk\">ucas.ac.uk</a>), go into \"Apply\" and click on \"Register\". In this first section, you'll be asked for personal details. Make sure your name is how it appears on your exam entries and certificates, to avoid any issues later. Your mobile number and email address are useful to include, as both universities and Ucas increasingly use these to contact you.</p> <p>Next comes the security bit. You'll be asked for a password (some schools and colleges will provide these for you) and some security questions. Remember:</p> <p>\u2022 Don't forget your password;</p> <p>\u2022 Keep the username generated safe;</p> <p>\u2022 You may need to know the answers to all your security questions in future.</p> <p>You'll now be asked if you are applying through your school or college. If so, you have to enter a buzzword provided by them. Make sure the correct school or college appears next. Finally, you'll be asked to verify your email address. Ucas will then send you a verification code to enable you to complete the form. Two hints here:</p> <p>\u2022 The code email sometimes does not come through immediately, so patience may be required;</p> <p>\u2022 If you're completing at school or college and using your personal email address, bear in mind that you may not be able to access the reply until you get home.</p> <p>Now you're ready to complete the other parts of the form. Remember that it doesn't all have to be done in one go; you can save at any point and come back to it another time. </p> <h2>Personal details</h2> <p>This section covers information about where you live, your nationality and your status for assessing your entitlement to student grants, loans and fees payment. The drop-down menus are clear enough, but here are a few things that may help:</p> <p>\u2022 Nationality: having a UK passport means you select \"UK National\";</p> <p>\u2022 Residential category: if unsure, answer the questions in the help box;</p> <p>\u2022 Student support: most home students should choose 02 (Local Education Authority);</p> <p>\u2022 Unique Learner Number: you may not have one of these - if so leave blank.</p> <p>You can ignore the \"nominated access\" question unless you really do need somebody (usually a parent) to act on your behalf at any stage. You must complete the disability/special needs section even if you don't have a disability (in which case choose \"none\"). Consider this question carefully - if there is anything to identify (eg dyslexia) it should go in this section.</p> <h2>Additional information</h2> <p>Here's where the answer \"I prefer not to say\" enters the fray, and here the help boxes are your friend. You must complete the \"ethnic origin\" section but you can select the above as a response. Your answer to the parental education question can be used during the selection process, but the occupational background answer isn't available to your choices until later. It isn't yours (ie \"student\" or your part-time job) - you should write in the job of your parent or guardian who earns the most. If they are unemployed or retired then enter the job they used to do.</p> <p>Summer schools and tasters can be included here. Don't forget to enter them even if you're saying more about them in the personal statement later.</p> <h2>Education</h2> <p>It's a good idea to wrap up this section before completing your choices and the statement. It's easy to make mistakes or miss things out, and the drop-down menus won't always correct errors. Here you'll record where you've been educated since you were 11, as well as the qualifications you've gained and those you're currently studying for.</p> <p>First, enter all the institutions you've attended, making sure you get the dates correct. If in doubt, check! Clicking on \"Find\" and \"Search\" should produce your school or college and the exam centre numbers. If you took exams, make sure you say \"yes\" when asked if you have taken qualifications. Occasionally you may need to enter the institution and exam centre number yourself.</p> <p>Once you've made sure all your schools/colleges are listed, you can start to fill in all your qualifications to date. For most this will be GCSEs.</p> <p>\u2022 Include all of your results, not just the As to Cs;</p> <p>\u2022 Some will be double awards under a different heading</p> <p>\u2022 Some will be short courses, again under a different heading</p> <p>It's now the same process for your A-level studies. For many this will entail clicking on \"Advanced Subsidiary\" for their AS levels and then \"Advanced GCE\" for their A-levels. If your school or college cashes in your AS results, this is a completed qualification and must be recorded. For exams still be to taken, put \"pending\" in the result box. While you can include modules and units - check with your adviser about this - few universities need this detail. Check \"other qualification type not in this list\" for BTec, GNVQ and other qualifications.</p> <p>Hints: have your certificates or result slips in front of you so there's no confusion about exam boards or dates.</p> <p>Some will have to include additional entrance tests in this section, such as BMat or Ukcat for medicine or LNat for law.</p> <h2>Choices</h2> <p>You can enter your choices in any order here - there is no preference order as they will be automatically sorted alphabetically. It's a good idea to put in and save those choices that are definite in your mind first and add the others later. This should help you focus on what you really want. Make sure you're choosing both the correct institution and the course when you click, and pay close attention to the campus code. Occasionally, the course is not taking place where you thought. It may be on a different site or be franchised out to another college and be miles away from the main site, potentially affecting your choice.</p> <p>Those intending to take a gap year and go for deferred entry for 2010 can identify their intentions here. Remember to outline your plans in your personal statement.</p> <h2>Employment</h2> <p>This section is all about paid work (part-time or full-time jobs past and present) not voluntary or work experience. These can be included in your personal statement, especially if relevant to your chosen course and career plans.</p> <h2>Personal statement</h2> <p>Don't type straight into the \"Apply\" section - use a word processor or similar, using the spell-check facility, and copy and paste over when you're ready. For the sake of compatibility, use Times New Roman font, size 12. Keep an eye on the length: more than 4,000 characters with spaces means trouble. You can use 47 lines, but Ucas advises that the last line can go missing in transmission to the universities, so beware of this. </p> <p>Once imported into the apply section, you'll see how much space you have left or if you are over the limit. Remember: you don't have to use all the space just because it's there. Be concise, don't waffle. And make sure it's all your own work.</p> <p>When you think it's finished, click \"Preview\" to see what it will look like when an admissions selector sees it. Click on \"Edit\" if you want to make any changes.</p> <h2>Some general hints</h2> <p>\u2022 Save as you go</p> <p>\u2022 At any stage, you can check your progress by clicking \"View All Details\";</p> <p>\u2022 Mark each section off as \"complete\" when you're ready.</p> <p>Your school or college will have their own arrangements for how you seal the deal, but everyone has to click on \"Pay/Send\" to forward the application to your referee. There are five tick boxes plus an \"I agree\" box here - it may seem tedious, but do read the text; you are saying that everything you've included is correct to the best of your knowledge.</p> <p>Now you're done! It's \u00a317 if you made 2 or more choices, \u00a37 if only one. Remember: it hasn't electronically winged its way to Ucas and the universities until your referee has completed the reference and pasted it into the application.</p> <h2>Common mistakes to look out for</h2> <p>\u2022 Previous surname at 16th birthday - don't fill in if it's the same as now</p> <p>\u2022 Home address: don't fill in if it's the same as your postal address</p> <p>\u2022 Email address: remember - a university selector will see this, so avoid anything rude and crude</p> <p>\u2022 Dual nationality: only fill in if you have a passport of a second country</p> <p>\u2022 Permanent residence/student support: the name of your local authority</p> <p>\u2022 Fee code: usually 02. Common mistakes are people selecting 01 (private finance) and 99 (other)</p> <p>\u2022 Further details section on Choices section: usually leave blank, but check if university needs completion (eg subjects for a combined degree)</p> <p>\u2022 Education: check for missing exams, including those to be taken, and ensure that all dates are included</p> <p>\u2022 Include other admissions tests</p> <p><strong>John Beckett is a higher education adviser at City &amp; Islington Sixth-Form College</strong></p>",

  "<p>The Sandinista government has launched a sweeping crackdown on non-governmental organisations, including Oxfam, prompting concerns about freedom of speech and democratic rights. </p> <p>Police raided the offices of two pressure groups, carting away computers and files, and a further 15 organisations are under investigation for alleged money-laundering and subversion.</p> <p>Critics condemned the move as a further sign of intolerance and authoritarianism by President Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader who was feted as a hero in the country's 1980s revolution.</p> <p>Several European governments are preparing to axe tens of millions of dollars in aid in protest, a sign of how much international support Ortega has lost since his return to power last year. \"It's a response to the deteriorating democratic environment,\" said one diplomat in the capital, Managua.</p> <p>Last month the government launched Operation No More Lies against NGOs it accused of embezzlement, money-laundering and subversion.

The agency pre-empted the raid by handing over material before police broke in.</p> <p>\"We are surprised and concerned by the allegations that have appeared in the media about Oxfam's operations in Nicaragua,\" said Barbara Stocking, the group's chief executive. \"For over 30 years we have respected Nicaraguan law, and carried out our work to overcome poverty and suffering in a transparent, accountable and non-partisan way.\" Oxfam would cooperate with any investigation, she added.</p> <p>Privately, officials from several other aid agencies questioned whether they could work in the western hemisphere's second-poorest country after Haiti. </p> <p>The government has defended its actions as a lawful attempt to control murky funding for opposition-linked local NGOs. Officials did not return calls.</p> <p>Ortega paved his return to power by endorsing a ban on abortion, which appeased the Catholic church, and neutralising conservative foes with a pact.</p> <p>Some of his most vocal critics have been former supporters who accused him of betraying Sandinista principles, a chorus which swelled as the president clashed with writers, poets and artists who had championed the movement during its war against US-backed Contra rebels. </p> <p>Violent attacks by pro-government supporters on recent opposition rallies have further dented the president's image.</p> <p>The focus of the crackdown is the Centre of Media Investigations (Cinco) and its head, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a high-profile journalist and son of a former president, Violeta Chamorro. His investigations into alleged corruption in Sandinista land deals infuriated the government.</p> <p>The other group raided was the Autonomous Movement for Women (Mam), which has criticised the treatment of women.</p> <p>\"The administrative and judicial harassment of Cinco and Mam is an outrage,\" said the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders.

  "<p>England will press the International Cricket Council to prove today that it retains credibility as the game's governing body by curbing the excesses of the Indian Premier League and imposing the official policy that Test cricket remains of paramount importance.</p> <p>It has not been a good month for naked capitalism but it continues unchecked as far as Indian cricket is concerned, as the IPL increasingly enforces divisive deals that could have huge repercussions for the game.</p> <p>Giles Clarke, the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, is expected to use the ICC board meeting in Dubai to condemn Indian behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings which have left England's officially sanctioned Test series against Sri Lanka next May on the point of collapse and could force the total abandonment of May international cricket in England.</p> <p>The feeling in England is that if the ICC does not regain control of the game by enforcing an international calendar to suit all then, rather than make an impending move into luxurious new offices in Dubai's sports city, it might as well just turn out the lights.</p> <p>The ambition of Lalit Modi, the chairman of the IPL, has been underlined by confidential negotiations with Sri Lanka's sports ministry which, if confirmed, would virtually give the IPL a controlling stake in Sri Lanka cricket affairs. Discussions have centred upon a $70m (\u00a340m) guarantee to Sri Lanka Cricket over the next 10 years if they offer unconditional support for India's Twenty20 plans for the next decade - whatever they may be.</p> <p>That would make inevitable the growing likelihood that Sri Lanka's tour of England will be scrapped - even though Sri Lanka have signed a tour agreement and the ECB has received no official admission from Sri Lanka Cricket that the tour is off. Compensation is the least that the ECB would expect, but that does not address the issue of who runs the international game.</p> <p>England - for reasons not just of their own financial health, but the future integrity of the game - have refused to bow to India's every unpredictable whim, seemingly unlike Australia who have abandoned their oft-stated suspicion of Twenty20 and are now waving begging bowls with much enthusiasm. For the ECB it is a principled but lonely position.</p> <p>That leaves David Morgan, the ICC president and a former ECB chairman, facing the most daunting test of his administrative career today. For once, he has abandoned his emollient tone and condemned the IPL's proposed deal with Sri Lanka Cricket as \"quite unacceptable behaviour against the background of Sri Lanka's signed agreement with the ECB.\"</p> <p>Haroon Lorgat, the ICC's chief executive, has insisted upon \"Test cricket's primacy\". To date, however, both have been unable to exert control.</p> <p>One problem for the ECB is that it is not only the 13 Sri Lankan players who want to play IPL. Privately, several England players will be hoping that next summer's Sri Lanka tour collapses. Modi's aggressive scheduling of the IPL to clash with England's May Test series has also prevented sought-after England cricketers such as the captain, Kevin Pietersen, from maximising their IPL earnings.</p> <p>Although some England players expect to play in the IPL next spring, they will be allowed a fortnight at best in a competition that runs from April 10 to May 25. Tests against Sri Lanka are theoretically scheduled for May 7-11 at Lord's and May 15-19 at Chester-le-Street, followed by a three-match ODI series from May 24-30. </p> <p>Such is the financial glut in Indian cricket that there are no signs so far that the global crisis is about to affect them. The deal being discussed with Sri Lanka could soon be offered to Pakistan. The likely outcome therefore is that the ICC's Future Tours programme will be designed around whatever extravaganzas that India wants. If they are denied an official window in the international calendar they will just build a house of their own. </p> <p>Indian talk of ICC irrelevance is often followed by assertions that English cricket no longer matters. The way to change that perception is for England to soundly beat India this autumn and create a few superstars in the process. Never has success been more sorely needed.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday October 14 2008. Homophone corner: 'Clarke seeks to reign in Indian influence as ICC meets'.

  "<p>Your article highlights the downside of single-mindedly pursuing the highest financial return (Lost in Iceland: \u00a31bn from councils, charities and police, October 10). For charities, in particular, this is an opportune time to re-examine the accepted wisdom of segregating the pursuit of charitable objectives from the management of financial assets. </p> <p>Instead of charities depositing their cash in a bank because it offers a titillating interest rate, what if they used their cash to also meet their charitable objectives? It is possible to earn a healthy interest rate by depositing funds in a bank with a capital adequacy ratio nearly double the mandatory minimum, with the knowledge (through full transparency) that deposits are only lent to organisations delivering positive social and environmental change. Now is the time for charities and foundations to demand more from their investment advisers, and make their money work harder by delivering social good as well as financial return. <br><strong>Whitni Thomas</strong><br>Investment manager, Triodos Bank </p> <p>Now that the government is set to take a controlling stake in RBS, it must ensure that some form of environmental as well as financial regulation takes place, and curb the billions of pounds that the bank has channelled into coal, oil and gas across the globe. RBS, which up until very recently styled itself as \"the oil and gas bank\", is the UK bank with the most emissions-intensive investment portfolio. Rather than simply writing a blank cheque, this bail-out should be conditional upon those banks which have benefited making a full disclosure of their fossil-fuel financing, as well as making a commitment to cap and reduce the carbon emissions embedded in their investments and loans. We have seen what happens when financial risks are concealed from the market. We must ensure that carbon risks are open and accountable.</p> <p>For the first time in living memory, the government has the potential to have a direct say in the lending behaviour of banks like RBS, and that opportunity should be used to take us down the path of climate as well as economic stability.<br><strong>Duncan McLaren </strong>Friends of the Earth Scotland, <strong>Mel Evans </strong>Platform, <strong>Bronwen Smith-Thomas</strong> People &amp; Planet, <strong>Jeni Mackay </strong>Scottish Education and Action for Development, <strong>Johan Frijns</strong> BankTrack, <strong>Geoff Nettleton </strong>Indigenous People's Links</p> <p>Yesterday's meeting between Iraq's oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, and oil giants Shell, BP and ExxonMobil (Report, October 13) should be a timely warning to all those who opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

And so it has proved to be. On the one hand, the occupation helps the US to shape Iraqi politics in its own interests, especially on oil policy.

  "<p>Alistair Darling was reportedly furious when he woke from a rare full night's sleep two weeks ago to hear that while he had been dreaming, Ireland had guaranteed deposits in all its six banks. The chancellor phoned Brian Lenihan, Ireland's finance minister, to ask why he hadn't been told. After a night in which he had rung his cabinet ministers between 1.30am and 2am and squeezed in two hours' sleep before then phoning EU financiers at dawn, Lenihan reportedly explained there had been no time.</p> <p>We can safely assume that \"I didn't want to disturb your beauty sleep\" was not part of Lenihan's explanation. It is not jobs, merchant banks or Iceland that have been the first casualties of the economic turmoil; it is sleep. Darling has enjoyed less than most. After last Tuesday's all-nighter with at least 30 Treasury officials, during which he grabbed some sleep between 1.40am and 4.50am, he was in Washington over the weekend to meet the G7 and the IMF, adding jetlag to sleep deprivation when he flew back to attend another banking bailout emergency meeting at the Treasury that ended at 2am yesterday. It is not just politicians who are suffering: Tom Scholar, a senior Treasury civil servant, reportedly managed to fit in only two hours' sleep in a 48-hour period ahead of last week's bailout meeting.</p> <p>This lack of sleep demonstrates the magnitude of the crisis, and to have people talking about it is useful for politicians as a demonstration of their determination and dedication. Many of the meetings have been held through the night because measures had to be devised, agreed upon and announced in the window between the UK stock market closing and opening, in an attempt to minimise volatility and panic selling. This is a global crisis and the markets never sleep, observers nod sagely. And at the moment, their masters must not either.</p> <p>Some might grumble that late-night meetings may show inefficient succombing to an old-fashioned macho working culture. But, in this crisis, putting work before sleep is logical, and according to the experts, logic is not something that disappears from the minds of the sleep-deprived. Working on an all-night session, people can still think logically, says Professor Jim Horne, director of the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, but they are unable to sustain more high-level thinking, such as being able to deal with the unexpected, respond creatively and flexibly to new situations and come up with innovative solutions - exactly what you might assume this unprecedented economic turmoil would require. Without any sleep, people are also more likely to unthinkingly comply - hence the all-night meetings of management versus unions of old - and also take risks. \"Part of the brain that tells you to be careful is knocked out. That may be why casinos stay open all night. People's ability to perceive risk is ignored,\" he says.</p> <p>Everyone knows that if we don't get enough sleep we make mistakes. More people are killed on Britain's roads through sleep-related accidents than alcohol-related accidents. Tired people make tragic mistakes. The Chernobyl nuclear accident, the space shuttle Challenger disaster, the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the Selby rail crash have all been attributed to human errors in which sleep deprivation played a part.</p> <p>Scientific experiments have shown that sleep- deprived drivers underestimate their degree of sleepiness - believing they are more awake than they actually are when put in a stimulating situation. In this way, says Colin Espie, director of the University of Glasgow Sleep Centre, our judgment is clouded and we overestimate our ability to get things done. Sleep-deprived people may believe they are working effectively because they feel they are putting in so much effort, but in reality they are putting more effort in precisely because they are sleep-deprived and their brains are not functioning so effectively. As Espie points out, working on an all-nighter decreases efficiency not just through sleep deprivation but by forcing us to be awake at a time when our bodies are shutting down and our circadian rhythms (or body clock) are telling us we should be asleep.</p> <p>From the late-night sessions in the House of Commons to Winston Churchill's five hours a night - topped up with a daily nap - there is a long tradition of sleeplessness in politics. Margaret Thatcher famously claimed to thrive on four hours a night. Gordon Brown does much the same even when not beset by a global slump. The No 10 press officer gave the irritable response of the sleep-deprived to my inquiries - clearly seeing sleep as a frivolous matter - but insiders say the prime minister goes to bed around 11.30pm on a normal night and rises to begin firing off emails around 4.30am. It is said he finds this the most productive time of the day, not least because he is not usually disturbed by officials. (If he was to sleep in any longer he would in any case still get woken up before 6am, which is when his two-year-old son, Fraser, currently rises in the Brown household.)</p> <p>This may not be a recipe for catastrophically impaired decision-making and is at least better than staying up all night. \"If Gordon Brown is doing that he is a very sensible man,\" says Horne. \"If his officials are up all night they are more likely to be making mistakes.\"</p> <p>The notion of a solid eight hours' sleep a night is a relatively recent western construct and before the 19th century there is evidence that we slept in two short shifts, divided by a period of wakeful thinking time around 1am. Horne gives short shrift to the idea that 24/7 capitalism is suffering a crisis of sleeplessness and we are all getting less than we used to: the working classes got far less in the Victorian era of 14-hour days and sharing beds in overcrowded and noisy conditions, he argues. The notion that we all need a solid eight hours' sleep is also simplistic: children and young people need more; many older people need less, and sleep requirements are often a personal thing.</p> <p>But the 21st-century response to lack of sleep is often to seek to master it with technology - propping ourselves up with artificial stimulants such as coffee or exercise, which only defer the need for sleep. One banker embroiled in the crisis meetings says he has been staying awake with weak tea. But caffeine is not fuel for the mind. Nor, for the record, is the karahi lamb and aloo gobi personally ordered by Darling from his favourite curry house during last week's epic bailout meeting.</p> <p>\"The ability of coffee to overcome those more subtle effects of a lack of sleep is limited,\" says Horne. \"There is no substitute for sleep.\" Unlike physical muscles, the brain cannot be refreshed and recharged through rest; it requires sleep and Horne's research shows that without at least four hours' sleep, the frontal area of the brain that looks after those complex executive functions such as responding creatively to unexpected circumstances is unable to function effectively.</p> <p>\"Daytime meetings would seem to be advisable for dealing with international crises,\" says Colin Espie. Failing that, politicians should at least be trying to catch up on their sleep with a power nap: even 30 minutes can make a difference, and naps are particularly effective because they can recharge the brain with the most useful kind of deep sleep we only usually experience for a portion of an ordinary night. Unfortunately, Churchill apart, napping in the office tends to be frowned upon and is still seen as an admission weakness.</p> <p>\"We're very familiar with the public health message - eat well, exercise, everything in moderation - and we seem to have forgotten that sleep is the primary factor that delivers quality of life. It's the one thing you can't do without,\" says Espie. \"The danger is we treat sleep as a commodity that you spend when you like, but it doesn't work that way. We're not in charge of it.\"</p> <p>As Espie explains, sleep deprivation is often defined by its consequences. But maybe it's too hopeful to think the current turmoil and our apparent inability to control it could all be sorted out with a good night's kip.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 24 December 2008 to correct the homophone; \"Without any sleep, people are also more likely to unthinkingly comply - hence the all-night meetings of management verses unions of old - and also take risks\".</p>",

  "<h2>Simon Richards <br>Teacher, south Wales </h2> <p>I don't think it's surprising that a new survey shows boys do better with male primary teachers. I've worked in primary schools that have no male teachers at all, but a lot of boys do seem to behave better with a male teacher. I'm not sure of the reasons. Maybe they come from backgrounds with no male role model, or simply feel they can connect better; it's important to have someone to talk to. This isn't just about getting more men to train. When they finish, there are very few jobs in certain areas. That's a major barrier. Also, a primary school is seen as a very feminine environment. Perhaps men feel they wouldn't have the disciplinary control that they would have at secondary level. And then there's the pay: if you were in charge of 30 people elsewhere, you'd earn a lot more than you do as a primary school teacher. Parents' attitudes also have to change. I've taught in nursery and reception, and I think parents feel a little uneasy about having a man teaching their children when they're very young.</p> <h2>TJ Taylor <br>Aged 16, Barnsley </h2> <p>When I was at primary school, we didn't have any male teachers, but we did have a semi-permanent one who came in when teachers were away, and everyone looked forward to him coming into the classroom. I think it's incredibly important to have male teachers, as boys appreciate having a man around. Men have authority over boys, especially rougher boys, and boys need role models in primary school, rather than all the male teachers being in secondary schools. A few months ago, I went back to help out at my primary school because my mum works there. They have a male teacher now and all the pupils look up to him so much, which was interesting. Last year, I helped out at the after-school club and I think the boys related to me more than to my mum. Teaching appeals to me and if I went in for it, I might go for primary teaching, but I'd be specialising in drama so I might be better off at secondary level. I went in to help with a primary school production and it was very satisfying, but I think it might have been even more so with older pupils.</p> <h2>Michele Harrison <br>Parent, London</h2> <p>I definitely think it's important to have male teachers at primary level. My son's primary has quite a few, he's lucky - over the past two or three years the numbers have been creeping up. But my older son, who's just moved on to secondary, never had a male teacher. He says he wishes he had, because they're easier to talk to. He really enjoyed having a male teaching assistant. He says that men are good role models; his words, not mine. He also says that more male primary teachers would encourage more boys into teaching. From the sports point of view, men tend to be the ones who will play football and do fun things with the boys. My son's primary has just set up a tag rugby team, which he thinks is great. The school has become more sporty, and I don't know if it's coincidence, but it has happened since more male teachers came in. How to encourage more men into primary teaching is a really hard question. I think it has to be an education process whereby men need to feel that what they're doing is worthwhile and can really make a difference. They need to be told that boys really need them, and that they are good role models for girls too.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair's former lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, yesterday dismissed as \"fanciful\" the government's argument that the fight against terrorism would be assisted by extending to 42 days the maximum period a suspect can be detained without charge. Leading a cross-party assault on the plan in the House of Lords, which last night overwhelmingly rejected the measure by 309 votes to 118, Falconer said he had decided to vote against his government with a \"heavy heart\".</p> <p>\"There is a very substantial threat,\" Falconer said. \"If extending the number of days would assist in bringing terrorists to justice, then we should do. Unfortunately I do not accept that proposition.\" He said he accepted that the police needed to assess a \"huge amount\" of evidence on computers in terror cases, but he said this could not be done in 14, 28 or even 90 days.</p> <p>The former lord chancellor supported the original proposal by Blair to extend the pre-charge detention period to 90 days in 2005. Falconer said he had changed his mind because police were now able to detain terror suspects by using the so-called \"threshold test\". This is a measure in the prosecutors' code which allows the authorities to charge a suspect on a lower threshold if they have a reasonable suspicion that evidence will be compiled in a reasonable time. \"It has changed in practice the basis upon which it operates,\" Falconer said. \"The idea that extending [the detention period] from 28 days to 42 days is going to make a difference is utterly fanciful.\"</p> <p>Lord Dear, a former West Midlands chief constable, who moved the amendment throwing out the 42-day measure, said there was \"no evidence to date\" that the existing 28-day limit had been insufficient, because most suspects had been charged within 14 days. He added that no other common law democracy had a limit as high as 42 days: the limit in the US was two days and in Canada one day. \"There is almost universal opposition to what the government proposes,\" Dear said. \"It almost beggars belief that any administration could embark on such a course.\"</p> <p>Lord Carlile, the Liberal Democrat peer who is the independent reviewer of anti-terror laws, took issue with Dear's claims on detention periods, which have been championed by Liberty, the human rights group. \"I have heard it said, this is a breach of Magna Carta. I disqualify that on the grounds of misrepresentation and over-reliance on a document which, though of its time, by today's values is sexist, racist. I would expect Liberty to march the streets against it.\" Carlile referred to \"a shameful advertisement by Liberty in today's Guardian newspaper [which said] ... we are proposing a situation far worse than that in the US, France and other comparable countries\".</p> <p>Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister who was injured in the 1984 IRA bombing of the Grand hotel in Brighton, warned his party's leadership that it might \"rue the day\" that it opposed the 42-day plan. \"Think of the dilemma if the government is denied these powers, but at some time in the future a Conservative administration concludes that it needs them,\" he said. \"How exactly would they go about coming back and asking parliament to grant those powers?\"</p> <h2>Labour rebels</h2> <p>The 24 Labour peers who rebelled are: Lord Ahmed, former minister Lady Blackstone, Lord Boyd, Lord Brennan, Viscount Chandos, former union leader Lady Dean, former minister Lord Dubs, former lord chancellor Lord Falconer, Lord Faulkner, Lord Grantchester, former lord chancellor Lord Irvine, Lord Joffe, former minister Lord Judd, Lady Kennedy, Lady Mallalieu, Lord Morgan, former attorney general Lord Morris, former transport workers' leader Lord Morris, former education secretary Lady Morris, Lord Patel, Lord Prys-Davies, former minister Lord Rowlands, Lady Uddin and Lady Whitaker</p>",
  "<p>A police officer yesterday admitted he had altered a key document about the events leading up to the shooting dead of Jean Charles de Menezes.</p> <p>An official investigation was announced into the admission by the officer, known only as Owen, who was the deputy surveillance coordinator on the day De Menezes was killed after being mistaken by police for a suicide bomber.</p> <p>Yesterday Owen told an inquest he had deleted parts of a record he made about the decisions and options being considered by senior officers as De Menezes was followed by police on July 22 2005.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, described the revelation as \"very serious\" and the De Menezes family said it potentially undermined the evidence of senior officers. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would start an immediate investigation.</p> <p>Scotland Yard said the officer had been placed on restricted duties while the investigation was carried out.</p> <p>On July 22 2005, Owen was working in the Scotland Yard control room, running the hunt for terrorists who had tried to bomb London the previous day.</p> <p>He made a computer note of what was being said by senior officers as a suspect, De Menezes, was followed from a south London address by surveillance officers.</p> <p>Yesterday Owen told the inquest he had deleted a line in his computer notes last week. The line said Commander Cressida Dick, the officer in charge of the operation, had at first said the Brazilian electrician could \"run on to tube as not carrying anything\".</p> <p>Her evidence to the inquest last week was that she wanted the man, who police thought could be a potential suicide bomber, to be stopped before he could board a tube train. Owen said he had removed the line on October 7 because he \"didn't see it as relevant\". </p> <p>On that day Dick was giving evidence for a second day at the inquest.</p> <p>Saying he was now not sure who had actually said \"Let him run\", Owen added: \"All I can say was that one of the options was letting him run because he was not carrying anything and that there's a disagreement between management. </p> <p>\"I believe it was the commander [Dick] but when I reflected I couldn't be sure or whether she was saying this is what we are going to do or this is one of the options.\" </p> <p>Owen said he mentioned the changes he made to a Metropolitan police solicitor the day after he submitted his evidence, on October 8. </p> <p>When asked if he was aware that what he had done was very serious, he added: \"I have removed a line I believed was wrong and gave a totally false impression.\" </p> <p>The deleted line read: \"CD - can run on to tube as not carrying anything. Persuaded by U/I male amongst management.\" </p> <p>After retrieving the notes, Owen said he \"flicked through\" them and saw there were a \"few mistakes\". </p> <p>He said: \"The other thing I have done is delete the line I had identified as wrong and misleading when I did the statement.\" </p> <p>This is not the first instance in the De Menezes case of police altering evidence. On the day of the shooting a surveillance log was altered to distance those officers who had been following the suspect from having made any positive identification.</p> <p>The original entry read: \"A split second view of his face. I believe it was [the suspect].\" The sense of this entry was reversed by the addition of two words: \" A split second view of his face AND I believe it was NOT [the suspect].\"</p> <p>Harriet Wistrich, solicitor for the De Menezes family, said: \"It is significant as another officer has been found to have altered key documents. If his document is accurate, it undermines the previous evidence of Cressida Dick and her command team.\"</p> <p>Since the tragedy, Dick has been promoted from commander to the rank of deputy assistant commissioner.</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",
  "<p>The users' forum on the Betfair betting exchange is not to everyone's taste. If some internet racing forums resemble a genteel discussion of matters of state in a Victorian drawing room, Betfair's can be more like a riot in the Coliseum. Some contributors like to think of themselves as Caesar, while others never tire of adding their voice to the raucous background noise. More tender souls, meanwhile, could well end up as lion food. </p> <p>But the Betfair forum is also by far the largest and most lively aggregation of racing fans and gamblers anywhere on the web. It has been an important part of the exchange's appeal almost from its launch eight years ago, a way to advertise the person-to-person basis of the site and increase the sense of community. </p> <p>Like any community, of course, it has its share of members with personality disorders: the bullies, the fantasists and barefaced liars, and the ones with such deep-seated anger-management issues that they should probably be under lock and key. But there are many others, too, who just want to talk punting with like-minded souls, and to do so in a forum where an honest opinion can be expressed, and even the odd insult hurled, without the sky falling in. </p> <p>That, at least, is how it has always been, and those who didn't like it could easily surf off elsewhere. As of yesterday, though, the barbed wire may have started to fence off the wild frontier. </p> <p>In a move which screams \"float\" even more plainly than the recent imposition of \"premium charges\" for some of its most successful clients, the responsibility for Betfair's forum has been hived off to a different part of the group - TSE Global Limited - with some important new procedures in place for forum users. </p> <p>In particular, it will now be much easier to \"report\" other users (or at any rate, it will when the new forum actually works, since yesterday's launch survived for barely an hour before it crashed). This can only lead to the fairly rapid sanitisation of the entire forum. </p> <p>Which is no bad thing, many would say. For anyone who has watched and admired Betfair's growth into a betting phenomenon, though, it follows the premium charge as the latest sign of the exchange's rapid corporatisation. </p> <p>The punters who came together to make Betfair what it is are now just a means to an end, specifically a chunky share price when it floats. The forum, meanwhile, is a bit of an embarrassment. </p> <p>Even Ben &amp; Jerry sold out in the end, so the clear urge of Betfair's founders to spend more time with their money is both understandable and thoroughly well-earned. But when they are gone, what will remain? </p> <p>This is surely the most intriguing question of all for punters who love the value and flexibility that exchange betting provides. Betfair's premium charge, remember, was apparently introduced because a small number of winners were felt to be draining too much money from the site's losers. Despite the dreadful PR, the money was required to keep the losers coming. </p> <p>There must have been some good reason to allow their few rivals, along with many of their own customers, to kick them all over the park, and this one seems as plausible as any. </p> <p>If Betfair had had a worthwhile competitor in the marketplace, though, it would never have dared to risk the loss of its precious liquidity. This, in turn, implies that its long-term viability may depend on the preservation of its effective monopoly in the market. </p> <p>Now try this for a leap of logic. If a business model requires a monopoly to stop its customers eating it from within, then it is possible to argue that in the long term, it is a business model that doesn't work - which would be a good reason to cash in right now. </p> <p>The graphs and projections at Betfair HQ no doubt suggest otherwise. It is arguable too that at some point in its expansion, it was inevitable that Betfair would want to draw a line under its humble beginnings and stride on into a shiny new profit-maximising future. Sadly, an edgy, rough-house internet forum probably has no place in that.</p>",
  "<p>Given that David Harrower's acclaimed 1995 play is entirely untethered by time or place, removing it from its original Scottish setting might seem like a waste of creative energy. But it's another tribute to his poetic, symbolic and unusual drama, in which the central female character is known only as \"Woman\", that Charlotte Gwinner's relocation of the story to rural Wales works so well.</p> <p>It helps that the Ustinov Studio offers truly intimate theatre, which isn't so much about being close to the stage as having the potential for plunging the auditorium into very near darkness. The play, which defies a plot summary because it's just so wilful and strange (to call it a love triangle feels unforgivably crass, but that is what it most resembles), is as close as you can get to a dream realised on stage, and so you need the real, lingering gloom as a backdrop. It also helps that the softness and lyricism of the words as spoken by the Welsh actors embellish some of the play's key lines, with a deepening of vowel sounds and an enriching running-together of words.</p> <p>All of this, however, is only the background to a tremendous performance by the three actors. Robert Gwilym and Rhys Meredith offer striking interpretations of the ploughman and village outsider, but it is Siwan Morris's presence on stage that really lifts the new version of Harrower's parable. You can see the play's themes and moods etched on her, from wide-eyed bewilderment at the start, to a knowing power at the end. Morris embodies this peculiar drama entirely - and in her hands, it makes a sort of sense. Like the best dreams, though, it's tricky to describe, and loses some of its rare, potent magic in the retelling.</p>",
  "<p>For all those people who moan about the current state of television, here is the evidence for the defence. I give you Exhibit A: <strong>The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall </strong>(Channel 4). Or, to be fair, Simon Block and Rowan Joffe, who respectively wrote and directed, give it to you. </p> <p>Tom Hurndall was the young British photojournalism student fatally shot in the head in Gaza by an Israeli Defence Force sniper as he was trying to shepherd a group of Palestinian children to safety. Hurndall is not a major character in this dramatisation, which begins with his end, or the beginning of his end - his shooting. Throughout the film he lies in a coma in a hospital bed, hooked up to all sorts of machines, until he dies. There are a couple of brief, visual flashbacks, but this is not a sentimental celebration of his life. Instead it focuses on the family, what Tom's shooting did to them, their struggle even to begin to comprehend a situation they knew very little about, and their fight - in a foreign land, against the might of the IDF - for some kind of justice.</p> <p>It may not be sentimental, or sensational, but hell, it's moving. I certainly choked up. Of course, this has a lot to do with the events themselves. (Tom's parents, who are divorced, both took active parts in the film's development to ensure its accuracy.) But it's also the poignant little details - a bad-tempered family row over dinner about whether young Freddy would like falafel or not; the other brother Billy's sleeping bag vigil outside Tom's hospital room - which make it all so incredibly human. </p> <p>There are two very fine performances - from Kerry Fox, as Tom's mum, a woman who grows in strength throughout; and, especially, from Stephen Dillane. His understated performance as Tom's dad - an upper-middle-class lawyer, buttoned up but with a lovely (and British) sense of decency and justice - deserves to win something.</p> <p>There'll be flak, of course. It's anti-Israel, people will say, probably anti-semitic, too. What about the innocent victims of suicide bombers? And what about the deaths of all the Palestinian civilians - why concentrate on one posh English boy who was badly prepared and arguably shouldn't have been there in the first place? But this is drama, and drama's job is not to give every side to a story. It is also drama based on irrefutable facts: one way into a story that is very hard for outsiders to comprehend.</p> <p>And actually the drama does explore the view from another direction: the IDF watchtower from where Tom was shot. Taysir Hayb, the soldier (an Israeli Arab, to complicate things further) who was eventually convicted of Tom's manslaughter, is a major character. There are all sorts of parallels. Now he is in Tom's father's sights, just as Tom was once in his. He is about Tom's age; we see him at home with his family, and he also has two brothers and a sister. We're seeing him in a not entirely unsympathetic light. We even see him, bored in the watchtower, chatting with the other soldiers about the merits of the Arsenal team. I don't know if this is deliberate, because Tom, in real life, was an Arsenal fan, but it certainly helps to humanise him. </p> <p>Incidentally, whoever did the subtitles clearly isn't an Arsenal fan, otherwise they would have spelt Patrick Vieira correctly. A bit rich, coming from me, who gets just about everything wrong, and from the Guardian. But I had to find something wrong in what was otherwise a wonderful piece of work. Beautifully observed, beautifully written, beautifully performed. And brave. </p> <p>I've noticed that the word \"literally\" is increasingly used to mean the opposite. In <strong>The Dark Side of Fame With Piers Morgan</strong> (BBC1), a woman called Dr Pam Spurr, who is described as a \"celebrity analyst and behaviourist\", is talking about an outfit that Nancy Dell'Olio wore to Downing Street. It was \"a red satin catsuit which literally screamed: 'I want attention. Whatever you throw at me, I have survived.'\" It didn't really though, did it Dr Pam? </p> <p>The ex-Mirror man is being very flirty, ladling on the charm to try to find out Nancy's secrets - where she and Sven first had sex, for example. Was it outside, perhaps? There's something quite unpleasant about it all, and I can't help thinking that this show should really be called The Dark Side of Fame<em> Is</em> Piers Morgan.</p>",
  "<p>Proposals in the counter-terrorism bill give the secretary of state unprecedented powers to intervene in inquests where supposed sensitive information is involved (Another blow to justice, October 13). If passed, this could mean that at the sole discretion of the home secretary, juries could be removed from some of the most controversial inquests into deaths in custody and other contentious deaths. These inquests would then potentially take place in private, with only government-appointed coroners and counsel overseeing the evidence.</p> <p>Deaths in custody and those involving issues of national security raise important issues of state power and accountability, and in a free and democratic society should be subject to close public scrutiny. As the inquest system is the only place where contentious deaths are investigated, it is crucial the system is open and transparent so that justice is seen to be done and public confidence in state bodies is upheld. The proposals in clauses 77-81 of the counter-terrorism bill serve only to create a climate of suspicion that the government is deliberately trying to suppress information that is in the public interest and deny bereaved families their right to find out how and why their loved one came to die.

  "<p>The acquisition of majority stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS could end up with the government spectacularly breaking its own rule on the national debt, experts said yesterday.</p> <p>All will depend on whether the independent Office for National Statistics rules that the government is in effective control of the banks in which it has taken stakes. If it does, it will include all the liabilities of those banks on the national debt, but only assets that are defined as \"liquid\". That excludes mortgages.</p> <p>When Northern Rock was nationalised, the ONS decided the Treasury was in complete control and its \u00a385bn of liabilities came on to the books. This pushed the national debt up to \u00a3632bn - equivalent to 43% of national income - and above the government's self-imposed limit of 40%. The part-nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley last month will probably add \u00a340-50bn to the national debt. </p> <p>The effect on the national debt of adding HBOS and RBS to the balance sheet could be huge, say experts at the thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies. </p> <p>RBS has total liabilities of around \u00a31.8tn, HBOS \u00a3660bn and Lloyds TSB \u00a3357bn. Against those amounts, though, would have to be set any short-term liquid assets those banks have, such as cash on deposit.</p> <p>\"If any of these banks were brought onto the public sector balance sheet, some of the liabilities are likely to be offset by the banks' short-term financial assets, though exactly how much is unclear,\" said IFS spokeswoman Gemma Tetlow.</p> <p>The \u00a337bn spent on taking stakes in the banks could end up having no effect on the public deficit figures for this year, since it may count simply as a financial transaction, where the government swaps money for bank shares.</p> <p>The government's hope is that in the medium term it will be able to sell off its stakes in the banks at a profit and pay the national debt down again. The fees it receives from banks for its money-markets funding and guarantees, as well as dividends on bank shares, should also benefit the public finances.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England will lend \u00a3100m to Landsbanki to help the collapsed and newly nationalised Icelandic bank repay its UK creditors, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, announced yesterday.</p> <p>In a statement to MPs, he said he had told the Icelandic finance minister that both countries needed to work together to help the creditors of failed Icelandic banks, who include many British savers, local authorities and charities.</p> <p>\"Our authorities have set up an arrangement, agreed in principle, for an accelerated payout to depositors,\" he said. \"We are also working with the Icelandic authorities to facilitate claims by UK charities and local authorities on their deposits held at these Icelandic banks.</p> <p>\"In addition, the Bank of England is today providing a short term secured loan of up to \u00a3100m to Landsbanki to help maximise the returns to UK creditors.\"</p> <p>Around 300,000 British depositors were left without their money when Landsbanki's online banking subsidiary, Icesave, collapsed.</p> <p>Last week, Iceland's government stepped in to take control of three of the country's biggest banks, freezing assets including \u00a34.5bn belonging to British savers.</p> <p>Yesterday's loan offer appears to signal a softening of the British government's tactics. Gordon Brown originally branded Iceland's refusal to guarantee British savings as \"totally unacceptable and illegal\", while the government used the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act to seize an estimated \u00a34bn in Icelandic resources.</p> <p>But there was increasing concern about the amount of British public and charitable-sector money deposited in Iceland's stricken banks. As much as \u00a31bn of local council money is thought to be at stake, with British charities estimating their exposure at around \u00a360m. \"There are more than 50 charities that have deposits there,\" said Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations.</p> <p>As Iceland's stock exchange remained closed for a third consecutive day, speculation continued yesterday that the British retail magnate Sir Philip Green was close to relieving the stricken Icelandic investment group Baugur of its interests in some of the UK's best-known high-street brands including House of Fraser, Hamley's, </p> <p>Mappin &amp; Webb, Oasis, Warehouse and Whistles. The Topshop owner visited Iceland at the weekend.</p> <p>Both Hamley's and House of Fraser emphasised their independence yesterday. Hamley's stressed that it was \"a standalone, independent British company\" and \"not a subsidiary of Baugur\".</p>",
  "<p>Belarus are braced to be without Alexander Hleb - described by their coach, Bernd Stange, as their Maradona, Beckenbauer or Pele - for tomorrow's qualifier against England but are confident they can check the visitors' momentum at the top of Group Six.</p> <p>Stange, whose squad have been preparing in Stuttgart for the sell-out tie here at the Dynamo Stadium, conceded yesterday that Hleb was still struggling with the ankle ligament injury he picked up while playing for Barcelona last month and was not expected to feature. \"Hleb has gone back to Barcelona so our biggest problem is that our best player cannot play in this match,\" he was quoted as saying yesterday. \"But, even so, I think my guys will go out with nothing to lose and they should not have any fear of their opponents.\"</p> <p>Stange has had a dramatic effect on Belarussian football since his appointment 14 months ago, hauling the national side up 35 places to 59th in Fifa's rankings. They have drawn at home to Germany and a strong Argentina side and defeated the Dutch, albeit after Marco van Basten's side had qualified for Euro 2008. Their narrow defeat in Ukraine in this qualifying campaign, after a cruel stoppage-time penalty, offered further evidence of their rapid development.</p> <p>The coach has been instrumental in achieving that progress. Stange is a former Stasi informer from his time coaching East Germany in the 1980s, and in 2004 he took Iraq to fourth place in the Olympics. His decision to omit several senior players in favour of a younger, more promising squad initially spread alarm but the doubters have been won over. \"It's no fluke, what we have achieved,\" he said. \"It's the result of a lot of hard work. </p> <p>\"[But] if someone like Hleb is injured then the team are missing their Maradona, their Beckenbauer, their Pele and it's even more difficult to spring a surprise. We have a young team who have gained a lot from their experiences in the last year. This is a huge challenge for us, but one we're looking forward to.\"</p>",
  "<p>British officials yesterday said the time was approaching when a large majority of the 4,000 British troops based in southern Iraq would leave, adding that a few hundred would remain to help train Iraqi security forces.</p> <p>The officials were responding to comments by Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, in an interview in which he was quoted as saying that Britain's military presence in Basra was \"not necessary for maintaining security and control\". He added: \"There might be a need for their experience in training.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office played down the significance of his remarks, arguing that 800 troops were directly involved in training the Iraqi army and that the remainder provided logistics and security. </p> <p>\"The [British] prime minister has already said that we have changed our role from combat to training and support, so I don't think there is any difference between Mr Maliki's views and ours,\" an official at the Foreign Office said.</p> <p>The MoD pointed to previous statements by Gordon Brown that there would be a \"fundamental change of mission\" for British troops, meaning a switch to training, next year.</p> <p>But Maliki's intervention will again raise the question of why so many British troops remain at Basra airport. His choice of words was pointed and critical and he was dismissive of the performance of British troops in fighting in Basra last spring.</p> <p>\"The British forces withdrew from the confrontation, from inside the city to the area of the airport,\" he told the Times. \"They stayed away from the confrontation, which gave the gangs and the militias the chance to control the city.\"</p> <p>The MoD responded tartly yesterday, insisting that the decision to withdraw UK forces from the Iraqi city to its airport last year was taken jointly with the Iraqi government and the US and was based on \"very sound military rationale\".</p> <p>\"Our presence in Basra city was a motivating factor for a large proportion of the violence in Basra and the decision to withdraw UK forces allowed the Iraqi security forces to develop lasting solutions to the security challenges in Basra. The transformation of the security situation in Basra is a vindication of that strategy,\" it added.</p> <p>In response to the question why the UK had not yet started negotiations with Iraq on a legal framework for any continued British military presence - a status of forces agreement - once the existing UN mandate expires at the end of this year, the MoD said: \"Our requirements are very similar to those of the US; we intend to use the Iraqi/US text as the basis for our agreement.\"</p>",
  "<p>What will be the fate of \"Britain's\" nuclear deterrent if Scotland becomes independent? If the result of the Glenrothes byelection on November 6 mirrors that of Glasgow East, an answer may soon be needed. This is the biggest conundrum among a series of challenges concerning Scotland's stance on defence if the country were to become an independent state - leaving England, Wales and Northern Ireland (EWNI) as a separate independent state.</p> <p>Defence is a fundamental attribute of statehood. Yet \"Britain's\" nuclear forces, which are supported by MPs and the general population in EWNI, are situated in Scotland. They are not supported by either the Scottish people or the Scottish parliament. Nor did the Scots support Britain's invasion of Iraq. The SNP's defence stance reflects both concerns.</p> <p>The submarines housing the Trident missiles are based at Faslane, near Glasgow. The nuclear warheads are stored at Coulport. The manifesto of the Scottish National party in the 2005 Westminster elections states that an SNP government of an independent Scotland will wish to move the Trident fleet and the nuclear warheads from Scotland. They would need to be relocated, probably Devonport in England. Whether the Trident force will be worth the extra expenditure required to set up new facilities will be a difficult problem for an EWNI defence budget under strain, although it would no doubt insist on Scotland sharing the cost of rehousing the base in any eventual agreement between the countries.</p> <p>As for conventional forces, the SNP wishes Scotland to continue to be a member of the European Union but not Nato - that is, it would follow the Irish example rather than the Danish. If Scotland withdraws from Nato it would become the first state to leave the alliance since it was formed 60 years ago.</p> <p>Scotland would have to decide whether to keep Scottish battalions and marines in Afghanistan. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the Nato-commanded military force, is authorised to deploy in Afghanistan under UN security council resolution 1776; it includes troops from 40 countries, many of which are not Nato members. The 2005 manifesto says that Scotland can participate in UN-authorised peacekeeping. So presumably Scottish forces can stay in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Both Scotland and EWNI will be the successor states to the UK under international law and both will be entitled to be members of the UN. EWNI will presumably claim the permanent seat at the UN security council. As for the UK's status as a nuclear weapon state under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), there is a precedent: on the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia became the successor nuclear weapon state while Ukraine and the other former Soviet republics became non-weapon states. Thus Scotland would follow Ukraine's example and apply to the International Atomic Energy Agency for a safeguards agreement as a non-weapon state under the NPT. </p> <p>There is unlikely to be any opposition to this provided that Scotland and EWNI agree the transitional arrangements needed to transfer the Trident base and warheads from Scotland to their new location. During the transition period the base and weapons can remain in Scotland without affecting its status as a non-weapon-state under the NPT provided there is no transfer of ownership and control of those weapons to Scotland.</p> <p>The SNP Conference in Perth this week will have plenty to discuss. Their decisions could reshape the strategic map of Europe.</p> <p>\u2022 Norman Dombey is professor emeritus of theoretical physics at Sussex University </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:n.dombey@sussex.ac.uk\">n.dombey@sussex.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The fact that the red bus which will parade our Olympic heroes through London on Thursday is so full is partly due to the continued pressure being placed on athletes, nations and federations who still pursue the use of banned substances. </p> <p>The appearance of Cera, the third-generation erythropoietin product, at the Tour de France in the summer was initially seen as another example of how the cheats are seemingly always ahead of the game in terms of utilising the latest technologies. Thankfully the development and successful implementation of a new test designed for this product is a further sign of how the coordinated approach encouraged by the World Anti-Doping Authority is coming to fruition at least in some areas. </p> <p>Continuous Erythropoiesis Receptor Activator does what it suggests. Developed by the pharmaceutical company Roche, it helps the kidneys to produce increased levels of EPO, which results in greater red blood cell development. The advantage of this product is that it is much more effective than its predecessors, producing a slower, more sustained release of EPO, reducing the need for regular injections. It was developed to aid patients such as those on dialysis but the sporting world sat up and took interest. </p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration in America refused Mircera, its trade name, a licence but only to protect its own EPO manufacturers. To its credit, Roche as early as 2004 realised the potential abuse of its product once it became readily available and contacted Wada to give it an early view of the drug's constitution to help the organisation develop a workable test. </p> <p>Our drug-busting friends in France finally came up with a reliable test in time for the Tour and at least three prominent cyclists were caught. Now the cat is out of the bag it's probable that this latest product will be seen predominantly in hospitals where it belongs. Thankfully the ability to retest stored samples may yet give us more positives. </p> <p>The IOC has given Wada permission to analyse the Beijing samples. At this point they will only be able to test the 969 blood samples that were taken at the Olympics and not the 5,000 or so urine samples that has been widely reported, although hopefully that will be possible in the future. The cooperation between the manufacturers, the testing labs, Wada and the IOC has in this instance shown how effective drug testing can be. </p> <p>The same cooperation is still not evident in other quarters, however, as the independent observers' report commissioned by Wada in Beijing has shown. Perhaps the most startling fact to come out was that 102 nations, half of those competing, were unable or refused to give adequate whereabouts information relating to their athletes in the immediate period leading up to the Games. The report suggests that many National Olympic Committees are sadly not even aware of their responsibilities in this area, a fact which the IOC has said it will look into as a matter of urgency. </p> <p>Ignorance is never an adequate excuse but it is slightly more palatable than complicity. During the Games there were eyebrows raised when certain athletes arrived in Beijing seemingly at the last minute. The Belarussian throwers were a case in point. Perhaps it came as no surprise that two of their hammer throwers, both medallists, were found to have tested positive for testosterone. They had already left again by the time the results were announced. But at least they were caught. They have been given until this Friday to offer explanations. </p> <p>The report makes interesting reading around these individual cases and others such as Fani Halkia, but it also highlights some of the smaller but significant issues around maintaining effective procedures and protocols. At a major Games the most probable way to escape a drug ban is to find legal fault with those trying to apply the rules. No system can ever be perfect, especially when much of it relies on human control, and therefore it's essential that all of those involved are diligent. </p> <p>As you might expect, the Chinese volunteers were particularly anxious to carry out their tasks to the letter. In the whole drug-testing procedure the job of notification and chaperoning can be onerous at times. Imagine trying to first catch up to and then follow Usain Bolt through his celebrations and media scrum to ask him to sign the testing form. </p> <p>Two volunteers were singled out for special mentions. One insisted on conducting a full lap of honour with the victorious hockey team, shadowing the chosen player. Another ended up enveloped in a basketball team's celebratory huddle but resurfaced with forms intact. It's that type of determination from all concerned that just might be making the work of the drug cheats harder by the day and keep them off the buses.</p>",
  "<p>It started when I was six weeks pregnant,\" says Lara Basini, 28, a Bristol midwife. \"I'd be in a shop and suddenly feel like there were 100 magnets dragging me to the floor. It was like being hit by a stun gun.\" Her dizzy episodes worsened, until she was bedridden, unable to care for her new baby. It would be a scary and debilitating three years before she was given a correct diagnosis. </p> <p>Balance disorders are among the 10 most common conditions seen by GPs and over half of us will experience one at some point. While a spot of room spin may sound minor, the reality can be anything but.</p> <p>There are about 350 recognised balance disorders, which can often be symptoms of other health problems. Diagnosis, therefore, is extremely difficult. \"Dizzy patients are 'heart sink' patients,\" says Andrew McCombe, spokesperson for ENT-UK and consultant Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey. \"It can take a very long time for doctors simply to decode the language people use to describe their symptoms. Words such as wobbly, woozy or faint don't really tell us what we need to know.\"</p> <p>Narrowing down a root cause requires great expertise and the Royal College of Physicians have called for more balance disorder specialists. </p> <p>The most common type of dizziness is probably vertigo - the false sensation of movement, like when you step off a boat or a big wheel and everything continues to undulate (fear of heights is, properly, \"acrophobia\"). Vertigo generally signals an inner-ear problem. Acute labyrinthitis is the most prevalent of these - a temporary viral condition that causes sickness and disrupts the balance. It usually clears up on its own, says McCombe, though patients may need medication to help with the sickness.</p> <p>Vertigo could, also, be a sign of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, a disturbance of the fluid balance in the inner ear that causes hearing loss, tinnitus, sickness and prolonged dizzy episodes. This affects approximately 50 per 100,000 of the population and although it tends to resolve itself, it may go on for months, or even years. Sufferers can become isolated - afraid even to leave the house in case they have an attack. Many end up with permanent hearing loss (usually in one ear). </p> <p>A fleeting but dramatic \"roller coaster\" sensation could signify another common inner ear disorder, \"benign positional vertigo\" (BPV). This is often caused by a head injury, or the degenerating effects of ageing. With BPV, tiny crystals, or \"ear rocks\", develop in the inner ear and rumble around, disrupting your balance mechanism. Usually, this happens when you turn over in bed, or tilt your head backwards to look up (which is why it is also called \"top shelf vertigo\"). Although BPV tends to clear up on its own, it can be terrifying, even dangerous if, say, you are at the wheel of a car. \"Some people get \"drop attacks\" where they are poleaxed without warning,\" says McCombe.</p> <p>The inner ear, however, is not always the culprit. Light-headedness, giddiness or a spaced-out sensation can be associated with panic attacks, depression or anxiety disorders. And the feeling that you are on the point of blacking out could suggest a circulatory problem (the brain not getting enough oxygen). While a tottery, unsteady sensation (\"disequilibrium\") might even suggest serious problems such as multiple sclerosis or a brain tumour. In the absence of diagnosis or treatment, it is little wonder people panic and become depressed.</p> <p>After Basini gave birth to Isaac, now two, the dizzy episodes worsened. She began to vomit and pass out up to 10 times a day. \"I'd struggle to stand up long enough to sterilize a bottle,\" she says. \"I couldn't even go to the local shop. It was like being horribly drunk with room-spin and nausea the entire time.\" She did not leave the house for seven months. Her surgeon husband, Steve Morgan, cut his hours and changed surgical specialities to care for her and their baby. </p> <p>One problem with a balance disorder is that there are no external symptoms. \"People thought I was exaggerating,\" she says. Even her GP suggested it might be depression. \"But I knew it wasn't in my mind.\" The symptoms became so dire that when doctors wrongly diagnosed a brain tumour, she actually felt relieved. \"If it's cancer you either die or survive: I knew I couldn't live like this any more.\"</p> <p>After 14 months she saw an ENT specialist who diagnosed an inner-ear problem called vestibular neuronitis. But after three months of balance rehabilitation exercises the spinning sensations got worse. Finally, almost two years later, Basini heard from a medical friend about a little-known speciality called neuro-otology (the treatment of balance disorders). She tracked down Dr SS Surenthiran, a consultant neuro-otologist who runs the Balance Centre at the Medway Maritime hospital, Kent. </p> <p>Surenthiran swiftly diagnosed \"migraine associated vertigo\", one of the most common conditions he sees. Since Basini had only ever experienced one migraine, which was during her pregnancy, she was sceptical at first. He put her on a special diet (cutting out triggers such as chocolate, cheese, MSG, dairy and citrus), and prescribed a migraine prophylactic. Almost immediately, she began to get better. </p> <p>Basini's case is worryingly common says Surenthiran. When the Balance Centre conducted a study of its patients this year they found that on average it took people 44 months to arrive at their door. During these months patients typically saw their GP about eight times and made four or five visits to two other hospital specialists.</p> <p>\"By the time they get here they'll have had months of referrals,\" says Surenthiran. \"They'll be on long-term sick leave, taking early retirement, facing house repossession. There is a vast strain on the family and a sense of worthlessness and despair.\"</p> <p>Surenthiran says he is able to give a diagnosis 95% of the time. \"You can see the weight lift off their shoulders,\" he says. \"They often say, 'Thank God, I'm not going mad.'\" The study showed that on average patients are 70% better nine months after they first visit the clinic.</p> <p>Basini, for one, says she is \"almost normal again\". She can now take Isaac to the zoo, the fairground and the park, all impossible before. \"I owe that man my life,\" she says.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Financial stability</strong></p> <p>The Treasury says the bank bail-out plan is driven by three priorities: \"To support stability in the financial system; to protect ordinary savers, depositors, businesses and borrowers; and to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer.\" Shareholders do not figure on the list.</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> stockmarkets bounced in London, Europe and beyond in response to the Treasury's move and similar measures from other governments. The FTSE 100 index closed up more than 8%. Meanwhile, the credit derivatives market, the best barometer of bank solvency concerns, also showed investors were increasingly confident that the prospect of bank failures was receding. </p> <p>At an operational level, however, bold moves by the Treasury to kickstart the interbank lending market did not have the hoped-for immediate impact on one of the biggest stress points within the banking system. The interbank cost of borrowing, Libor, reached almost unprecedented highs last week and remains disturbingly above central bank base rates throughout the western world. This means banks are still tending to hoard cash and liquid assets, unwilling to lend them to rivals.</p> <p>More optimistic analysts believe the latest initiatives from governments round the world will show through in Libor rates soon. \"It's enough to get these money markets up and running again,\" said David Keeble, head of rates strategy at French investment bank Calyon. \"But it might take a few weeks to filter through.\"</p> <p><strong>Banks' financial strength</strong></p> <p>The Treasury is to inject up to \u00a337bn into new shares in RBS and a merged HBOS and Lloyds TSB. It insists that after these measures - and independent capital-raising moves by banks - these institutions will each have capital cushions capable of absorbing the heaviest losses imaginable. These solvency buffers will be \"well above international minimum standards and at a level that should put them on a strong footing for the future\". </p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> IMF data shows British and European banks have about half the capital cushions of their US counterparts, so measures bolstering these positions will be widely welcomed. </p> <p>Nic Clarke, an analyst at brokerage Charles Stanley, said: \"The regulators have made it clear to UK banks that, whatever the cost to shareholders, they have to have a warchest of capital to see them through a serious downturn. In recent years banks have been running 'capital lite' models to maximise return on capital.\"</p> <p><strong>Dividends</strong></p> <p>Mindful of public unease at the level of profits made by banks in recent years, the Treasury claims to have won commitments on the distribution of future profits to shareholders. Its hand is strengthened by holding preference shares, which will absorb the bulk of surplus profits in the form of interest payments ahead of ordinary shareholders.</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> among the few shares that did not rally on the London Stock Exchange yesterday were the three banks pursuing government-backed cash-calls. Lloyds TSB, RBS and HBOS closed down 14.5%, 8.3% and 27.5% respectively. These bank shares have in recent years been popular with many income-focused investors, including most pension funds, because of their dividend policies. Many of these investors will be ditching these shares now the government is attempting to curb payouts. More than two million private shareholders in HBOS will be hit. Richard Hunter of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said: \"Dividend payouts are going to be depressed. You could well see bank stocks being pretty dour for the foreseeable future.\"</p> <p><strong>Treatment of borrowers</strong></p> <p>The government imposed conditions on mortgage activities and lending to small businesses as part of the deal. For three years, the Treasury is insisting, banks in which the taxpayer is invested must keep the mortgage market open and competitively priced \"at 2007 levels\". The banks must also provide \"support for schemes to help people struggling with mortgage payments to stay in their homes\".</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> these are warm words that many small businesses and homeowners will cling to. But it remains to be seen how they will be interpreted by the arm's-length body charged with overseeing the government's bank stakes on \"a commercial basis\". Lloyds has already revealed as part of its pact with government it will publish in its annual report details of small business loans, overdrafts and foreclosures. Others are likely to follow suit.</p> <p><strong>Curbing executive pay</strong></p> <p>Another condition wrung out of banks seeking taxpayer cash is a commitment to keep executive pay in check. The government expects no bonuses to be paid to boardroom directors in 2008. It also claims to have extracted promises that future bonus schemes will be linked to \"long-term value creation\" and will take account of risk. The kind of pay packages that allow highly incentivised executives to still keep hold of so-called \"payments for failure\" will be consigned to history, the Treasury said.</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> the FSA has written to 30 banks warning them it will require them to hold more capital if it sees pay policies deemed to be encouraging excessive risk-taking. This is a strong shot over the bows, but the regulator does not have many powers to enforce its preferred pay schemes. Now the government is to hold shares in the banks, its mind may be more focused on ensuring key jobs are given to the best people money can hire. Gary Hoffman, poached from Barclays to lead nationalised mortgage bank Northern Rock, will be paid \u00a32m over two years, making him Britain's best-paid civil servant.</p> <h2>What are the dangers?</h2> <p><strong>1 Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> If its share price stays well below the 65p the government will pay for its 60% stake, it could signal investors believe the plan will fail. Ditto Lloyds TSB and HBOS.</p> <p><strong>2 Barclays</strong> The bank is going it alone. Failure to raise capital in the markets would send it back to be offered worse terms.</p> <p><strong>3 Libor</strong> The interbank lending rate is a barometer of confidence; any increase is bad. It fell yesterday. </p> <p><strong>4 Wall Street</strong> A repeat of wobbles last week over Morgan Stanley could start a new round of global sell-offs.</p> <p><strong>5 Recession</strong> Falling growth, employment and house prices indicate this will be the biggest hurdle.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday October 15 2008.

  "<p>Less than two months after Stuart Law lambasted Lancashire's cricket committee for not renewing Dominic Cork's contract, he has been relieved of the captaincy and informed that his services as a batsman are no longer required.</p> <p>Glen Chapple will take over but the county insisted that Law's attack on \"the people sitting up there drinking gin and tonics\" had nothing to do with their decision to show him the door after seven summers, the last of them as captain. \"When Dominic went it was because we've got some young bowlers who we want to give more chances to, and with Stuart it's the same thing with young batsmen,\" said the chief executive, Jim Cumbes. Law will be 40 on Saturday.</p> <p>Lancashire have noted that Martin van Jaarsveld, the South African who was the leading run-scorer in the First Division, is unsettled at Kent, especially as his wife is from the North-west. However, he would need to obtain a release from his county.</p> <p>With only 704 championship runs from 21 innings, this has been Law's leanest season since he joined Essex from Queensland in 1996. Moreover his involvement in the rebel Indian Cricket League, where he is leading the Chennai Superstars for the third Twenty20 event in 12 months, could have put Lancashire in danger of being excluded from future Champions League competitions, as Kent were this year.</p> <p>Chapple's appointment is more of a surprise than Law's sacking. The 34-year-old all-rounder is easily Lancashire's longest-serving player but he had no captaincy aspirations until he led the team in a couple of one-day games late last season. However, he is a popular and respected figure and said he was \"delighted and proud\" to take the job after overcoming his initial reservations about succeeding Law.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/houseprices\">House prices</a> are continuing to tumble, with the number of sales for each estate agent falling to a record low of less than one a week, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says today. </p> <p>The latest Rics monthly snapshot of the market shows that a balance of 84% of surveyors saw falling rather than rising prices in September. The new number is worse than August's balance - when 82% more surveyors saw prices falling than rising - and reverses small improvements in the number in recent months.</p> <p>Rics' spokesman, Jeremy Leaf, said: \"The recent turmoil in the financial markets has dented confidence further but yesterday's announcement by the government that the recapitalisation of banks will be accompanied by increased lending to homeowners raises the possibility that the lack of mortgage finance that has so damaged the housing market might be eased.\" </p> <p>But Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight, said: \"House prices seem poised to fall substantially further as the fundamentals remain largely negative even though tracker mortgage rates have fallen following the Bank of England's 50-basis point interest rate cut. </p> <p>\"Even if the bold government measures to tackle the financial crisis work, it will undoubtedly take time for confidence to improve and mortgage lending to pick up significantly. Meanwhile, demand for mortgages is likely to remain muted for some considerable time.\" </p> <p>The average number of transactions per surveyor over the past three months was 11.5, the lowest figure since the survey began in 1978. London is the worst-hit region, with only eight sales on average over the past three months. </p> <p>London also suffered a sharp fall in the prices balance, as did Wales, the north, the north-west and the east Midlands. By contrast the south-west, west Midlands and East Anglia saw a slight improvement, while other areas saw little change.</p> <p>\"As it stands, only those with significant finances are in a position to access the market,\" Leaf said. \"The housing market continues to hold its breath and unless mortgage liquidity improves, the market is likely to remain a dormant beast for some time to come.\"</p> <p>Recent Bank of England figures showed that mortgage lending fell by 95% in August from July, with net mortgage lending down to \u00a3143m from \u00a33bn in July and the lowest level since records began in April 1993. The number of mortgages approved for house purchases tumbled 70% in the year to August to 32,000. </p> <p>Nationwide, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, announced it was raising its tracker rates for new borrowers yesterday, despite last week's interest rate cut. \"The changes we are making will allow us to maintain control of the volume of business the society is attracting, and continue lending in a prudent and responsible way,\" said Matthew Carter, divisional director for mortgages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338567621\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/14/HOUSING_MARKET_1410.jpg\" alt=\"Graphic - housing market\" width=\"461\" height=\"505\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",

The award show's producers raised their eyebrows and dug their nails into their palms. The audience cringed, but the 88-year-old continued his angry rant against the poor quality of German television, suffering a coughing fit in the process.</p> <p>He had been grateful, he said, for the Goethe prize, the Thomas Mann prize and the plethora of other literary awards that had come his way over half a century. But he could not be grateful for the highest TV accolade, from the annual German Television Awards, and was handing it back. German TV was \"boring\" and \"full of cooks, nothing but cooks\", he said.</p> <p>The Polish-born writer was not, of course, referring to his talkshow, The Literary Quartet, which ran for 13 years and turned him into Germany's most prominent and controversial literary critic, but rather to the slew of casting shows, cheap soap operas, supermodel searches, game shows and reality shows that makes up most German television. In truth the programming is not really any worse than the fare offered by any other European country. But this is Germany, where, by law, the first duty of the state broadcaster is to educate its audience.</p> <p>Increasing numbers of Germans are now refusing to pay the quarterly \u20ac53 (\u00a341) licence fee, arguing that state TV is not fulfilling its obligations, much to the wrath of the tenacious licence-fee collecting organisation, which sometimes sends its agents round to the homes of suspected licence dodgers in the middle of the night. (Last month it even sent a demand to Friedrich Schiller, the German poet who has been dead for 200 years.)</p> <p>Ironically, Reich-Ranicki's outburst has been hailed by those he attacked as an all-time highlight of German television. His outburst, said Markus Sch\u00e4chter, head of the state channel ZDF, was television \"at its best\". It attracted so many downloads on YouTube that he has now been invited back to take part in a televised round-table discussion to vent his spleen against the men in charge.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Order of preference</strong></p> <p>In Francis Gilbert's article on choosing a secondary school (Open season, October 7), he states that where local authorities offer one school place only, this \"means that if a parent has put top of their list two schools for which their child does not meet the criteria, then their third-placed school may be full by the time the application is considered. As a result, the child is given an offer of a place at the nearest school that has places - often one that is miles away and not very good.\"</p> <p>In fact, the new school admissions code prohibits admissions authorities from giving priority to children according to the order of preferences on their application forms. In the case Gilbert cites, the child's application for the third school on her list would be considered at exactly the same time as everybody else's, giving her the same chance as them of getting in.</p> <p>This situation is relatively new in some areas and still widely misunderstood. Parents should list schools in their true order of preference, without fear of spoiling their chances at any particular school. If in doubt, they can check with their local authority's school transfer adviser.<br><strong>Sue Eedle</strong><br>London N10</p> <p>\u2022 Francis Gilbert makes some good points but neglects to point out that, at best, league tables of school performance are totally irrelevant, simply signposting where the well-off live. At worst, they are demeaning to schools with hard-to-teach children and hard-to-reach parents: a ritual humiliation that deflates aspiration and lowers the morale of those working in and with the toughest communities. The attempt to justify contextual value added (CVA) as a valid measure misses an important point. Schools with a large intake of pupils with special educational needs (including special schools) are unlikely to reach the CVA benchmark, and yet may be stunningly good schools. The best advice to parents is to go and see the school.

  "<p>The human face is a miracle of nature. It can communicate nuances of emotion just by tweaking a muscle, it allows our brains not just to see the world but in some sense - through a smile or a grimace - to be seen by it. I discovered exactly how amazing the human face is when half of mine stopped working on Valentine's Day last year.</p> <p>The early 19th-century Scottish anatomist, surgeon and medical artist Charles Bell identified a peculiar medical condition in a paper to the Royal Society in 1821. Inflammation of the seventh cranial nerve, he pointed out in the course of a revolutionary description of the nerves of the head, can result in a temporary paralysis to one side of the face. He had observed it in young farmhands in wintertime. To this day, that illness is called Bell's palsy.</p> <p>I woke up with it just over 18 months ago. Despite walking around all day with a headache and a numb feeling in my face, I didn't really think much was wrong until my wife, Sarah, pointed out I looked a bit different and we did what we always do in medical emergencies - phoned Sarah's parents who are both doctors. That was how I received my diagnosis of Bell's palsy from Dr Angela Currie: it was such a classic case, she could spot it over the phone. And that was about all the medical profession could do. The doctor I saw the next day said that, although some people prescribe steroids to kick start a recovery, there's no statistical evidence that intervention makes any difference. Bell's palsy is usually caused by a virus. Most patients make a complete recovery by themselves. It's not painful or life-threatening. So why did I recently find it in a book called 100 Diseases You Wouldn't Want to Get, right next to bird flu?</p> <p>Because it made me look, for a few months, like Victor Hugo's Quasimodo. \"Oh, you poor chap,\" said one medical professional, a little unhelpfully. The effect of having the left side of my face become immobile, with an eye that didn't blink and a mouth that twisted abstractly when I tried to smile, made me feel like a medical freak. I felt bizarre - and looked, for a time, a lot more bizarre than I felt. I looked like a gargoyle. I discovered how lucky I am to be surrounded by people whose sensitivity made me feel OK about this, or unaware of it, because when I encountered less understanding contexts I felt very uneasy. In those early weeks after diagnosis I felt stared at in the street, at the airport, in hotels. Disliked even. A psychology book I recently consulted says of Bell's palsy that \"you may have seen people like this on the street\". Yeah, and it might have been me. I cancelled any TV engagements I had. Fortunately I work at home: going in to an office every day would have been hell. As a writer you can control your social visibility more than in most professions. </p> <p>I live my life through art and look for artistic connections in everything, so, of course, I turned to art in this unusual situation. I found comfort in a painting at the National Gallery: Francisco Goya's portrait of his friend Andr\u00e9s del Peral, gilder to the Spanish royal household and small-time art collector. Peral, posing for Goya in about 1798, with his long, greying hair given a sparkling lift by the silvery sheen of his jacket, faces you with his arm stuck into his shirt, Napoleon-style, and seems from a distance an arrogant, disdainful man. Then as you approach, you realise his striking look of contempt is actually a facial weakness: the side of his face that he holds back from us hangs downward - it is palsied. Maybe it's the result of a stroke, maybe it actually is Bell's palsy. Doctors, please tell us if you think you know. But this is a great painting: Goya does something infinitely more complex than simply turn a weakness into a strength. When you first see Peral he looks cold and harsh: when you realise this aggressive look is actually the product of weakness, it humanises him. His ailment makes him warmer.</p> <p>I knew this painting and it reassured me in the period when I actually looked much worse than Peral. I think when I mentioned it to people they thought I was kidding myself, but what I really meant - I believe - was that if the condition didn't completely heal, if there was a residual permanent effect, well, you can look distinguished and noble in your weakness, like Peral. Of course, in the event I just got better, like most Bell's palsy sufferers. It was not that big a deal.</p> <p>\"Why do you trivialise it?\" I'm sitting in a London cafe having breakfast with a distinguished man in a suit. I make sure to fix my eyes on James Partridge, despite my long-held fear of burns. Partridge was in a car crash when he was 18. The petrol tank went up and he suffered terrible burns to his face and body. Today he runs the organisation Changing Faces, which takes its name from his 1990 book - at once autobiography and advice - that tries to pass on what he has learned. The charity supports people with disfigurements and campaigns to transfigure attitudes. Partridge's face, the face he has after many operations, is one I find myself falling for. This is because of the way he displays it. He shows his face, he exercises and animates it before me. He is an extraordinary individual who convinces me that one of the worst fates I can imagine can be not just survived but even followed up with a life of joy. And he asks why I trivialise Bell's palsy? </p> <p>He points out that a small disfigurement (if it is permanent, unlike Bell's) can ruin someone's life as easily as a major one. Psychological studies show there is no correlation between the scale of a disfiguring injury and the psychological suffering it causes. And this is all made much worse by our deep investment of moral value in beauty. In the Renaissance they were explicit about it: we are covert and hypocritical.</p> <p>Our ideas of beauty and ugliness ultimately originate in Renaissance art. In a new exhibition opening at the National Gallery tomorrow, Renaissance Faces, you can see Henry VIII as a boy, captured in painted terracotta by the Italian artist Guido Mazzoni in about 1498. He giggles infectiously. We know he will die a bloated serial wife-killer but he's a lovely looking lad in this portrait. He is surrounded in the twilit Sainsbury Wing galleries by the kind of perfect human beauty Renaissance artists are famous for celebrating. The smooth-faced, straight-nosed, wavy-haired couple, sculpted in a marble relief by the Venetian artist Tullio Lombardo in the early 1500s, share a physical perfection so pristine that male and female blend into one another; gender dissolves before the magic of beauty.</p> <p>Renaissance artists believed explicitly what today we believe implicitly. We do not go around saying, as they did, that there are correct proportions for every anatomical feature - a correct mathematical symmetry of eyes and ears, legs and arms, against which everyone's appearance can be judged. Yet in reality everything in our culture constantly tells us this is so. On screen, in games, in magazines, there are the beautiful people, and at the opposite pole there are monsters. Most of us, of course, muddle on somewhere in between. Yet in so far as we still admire perfect beauty we still depend on the existence of its opposite - the face without order, harmony or composure.</p> <p>Officially, ours is a culture that acknowledges difference. In reality, ugliness, especially when it borders on what the Renaissance would have happily called \"monstrosity\", is still surrounded by prejudice and nightmare. No disfigurement is more shrouded in horror in my own imagination than the one Partridge has and I can honestly say meeting him, talking to him, blew away images of burns that have festered inside my head all my life: I remember seeing burned airmen in a war film when I was a child and, pathetically, that film, which gave me nightmares, shaped my dread of this type of injury right up to this week, when I met him. So this really is about images.</p> <p>I normally dislike it when art is spoken of in terms of positive and negative images - as if Marc Quinn's statue of Alison Lapper became good art because it was positive; it did good work. The aesthetic deadness of Quinn's sculpture, as sculpture, for me negates its human worth. But images really do haunt and shape us. They can also liberate us.</p> <p>I want to show Partridge my favourite image of an out-of-the-ordinary face in any portrait ever painted. It is Domenico Ghirlandaio's An Old Man and His Grandson, painted in Florence in about 1490. A man looks down from heavy lidded eyes at a young - and beautiful - boy who looks up at him tenderly: the boy is looking straight at the old man's distinguishing feature, his nose, which is massive and malformed, covered in tumour-like bulbs (the medical term is rhinophyma). It turns out that Partridge has a reproduction of it in his office. Of course he does. Because I can't think of a work of art in the world that more tenderly, simply, honestly and truly says all the things Partridge is trying to get across through Changing Faces, and that our society needs to get its head round.</p> <p>Partridge says people sometimes tell him beauty is an \"inner\" thing, but he doesn't buy that. Our bodies are who we are. What is hard for people to understand is that he doesn't try to ignore his face: \"I'm very proud and pleased with my face. I'm not in any way unhappy with it.\" And I can see that this is true.</p> <p>In the Ghirlandaio painting, the boy who looks up at the man's nose is not ignoring it: there is a \"marvelling\", as Partridge puts it. And this is what I too find so insightful about the painting. I think it is infinitely more humane than any number of positive images that might be circulated today because it is truthful. Art can help us to think more sensitively and humanely about others not by concealing reality, and not by simply making a banal point of diversifying images, but by the kind of rich, deep sense of life's magic that hums in Ghirlandaio. In his painting, fascination defeats revulsion, and individuality triumphs over ordinariness. Far from looking past an unusual feature, airbrushing a blemish, this Renaissance painter emphasises it as part of the man's identity. Ghirlandaio was probably commissioned to commemorate the old man by his descendants: in the exhibition at the National Gallery you can see how it was based on a deathbed drawing of the man with the marvellous nose. In the painting he comes to life again, a gentle grandfather, adored by the perfect-featured boy to whom his \"disfigurement\" is part of a person he loves and will never forget.</p> <p>Nearby hangs a drawing by Albrecht D\u00fcrer of his friend Conrad Merckell, whose twisted nose D\u00fcrer turns into a grotesque fantasy: it was done for Merckell, it is an act of friendship, and its exploration of the serpentine, gargantuan possibilities of the human face can stand as an image of how great art liberates us from cliched ideas of beauty. Even the Mona Lisa, some doctors have observed in one of the very many theories about this painting, has a slightly unbalanced smile - that's right, she has in one perhaps eccentric view been diagnosed with Bell's palsy. An after-effect of Bell's is even called Mona Lisa syndrome. It is true that asymmetry is part of this painting's beauty: as the art historian EH Gombrich pointed out long ago the left and right sides of the picture don't add up. After the Renaissance gave way to the Baroque, this appetite for asymmetry became an addiction. Vel\u00e1zquez and Rembrandt portray people as masses of colour, as palettes of imperfection: when Vel\u00e1zquez portrays dwarves he relishes their unique bodies and faces. As for Rembrandt, there is no \"health\", no \"perfection\" in his world and it is by discovering the strangeness of every face that he reveals the marvel of humanity.</p> <p>In the first days of my Bell's Palsy experience, I went to Barcelona and something happened that now strikes me as significant. I fell rapturously in love with the architecture of Antoni Gaud\u00ed. I mean, I've always liked Gaud\u00ed's spiralling soaring mosaic abandon, but this went beyond admiration - it was ecstatic. And perhaps this was no coincidence. Gaud\u00ed is one of the most anti-classical artists of all time: his imagination rejects symmetry like the plague, laughs at elegance, transcends order. It is sprawling and chaotic. Perhaps, as I nursed my temporarily bizarre face among the medievalist delights of Gaud\u00ed's Sagrada Familia, I was for a moment truly like Quasimodo, whose deranged form makes him the living human embodiment of the architecture of his Gothic home, Notre Dame. My unusual medical experience made me see that beauty and ugliness are meaningless words, that all forms are marvellous, that the perceived perfections, imperfections and average in-betweens of our bodies, including our faces, are to be savoured as part of the crazy chaotic wonder of life.</p> <p>It turns out that Charles Bell was also an artist. He trained in art before turning to medicine, and illustrated his own books: he also did graphic portraits of the soldiers with facial wounds he treated at the battle of Waterloo. He learned a lot about the nerves and muscles of the face from the traumatically exposed faces he saw in the Napoleonic wars. Bizarrely, the Goya painting that helped me is connected with Bell - for they both looked into the extremes of human appearance during the Napoleonic wars. Bell even treated the wounded of Britain's retreat from Coru\u00f1a, in the Spanish campaign that was also part of Goya's experience. Yet in the end, Bell's diagnosis merely defined a curiosity. Goya's portrait of Peral imagines a human possibility.</p> <p>It was strange, as someone who looks at art for a living, to suddenly find myself visually defined by illness. Bell's palsy is essentially, in modern medical parlance, a \"cosmetic\" disorder. Science can only describe it. Art can help you live with it and even teach you to value it as an aesthetic adventure. A lot of people get better in three weeks or so from this unusual condition; my face took about four months to start looking more \"normal\". The experience was prolonged enough to make me a bit shyer, a bit more hesitant in some contexts - perhaps even a bit less rude in my criticism, as I became more concerned that people should accept me. But I got over that and I got over the \"face thing\", as I called it. Lots of people have facial differences they must live with permanently. I've written this as a reminder to myself, before this experience becomes part of my ancient history, never to look at such people without imagining the mind behind the face: to look at others through Goya's eyes, not Bell's \u00b7</p> <p>\u2022 You can respond to Jonathan Jones' article and view a gallery of weird and wonderful Renaissance faces <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/art\">theguardian.com/art</a></p>",
  "<p>George Burley yesterday accused Kris Boyd of lacking respect for Scotland and for the national team's manager by refusing to be considered for future international squads while Burley remained in control.</p> <p>That announcement triggered an unseemly aftermath to Saturday's scoreless draw with Norway at Hampden Park and an acerbic Scotland manager yesterday highlighted the Rangers forward's decision to \"turn his back\" on his country. \"I think he has shown a lack of respect to his country and myself,\" Burley said.</p> <p>Boyd, who has featured in only 28 minutes of international football since Burley was appointed in January, joins his Rangers club-mate Lee McCulloch in withdrawing his services. The Rangers and Scotland captain, Barry Ferguson, now 30, has already admitted he will consider his international future at the end of the World Cup qualifying campaign.</p> <p>Burley, visibly perplexed at having to explain the situation at a hastily arranged news conference, said: \"For me, it's important that players show commitment and passion to play for their country. There are areas where you may be upset, but it's your country. They come in, they stay in five-star hotels and in this day and age they have massive wages. How much do you care? </p> <p>\"You don't need to like everybody. What we need are people willing to fight for the cause, go to war for the country, roll your sleeves up and go for it. The only ones I'm interested in are those who want to play for their country, those who are committed. The others don't come into play for me.\"</p> <p>Burley was relaxed about his unwillingness to use Boyd more than sparinglyeven though the 25-year-old has scored seven times in 15 appearances, because, despite a similarly impressive return for Rangers, he has also failed to command a regular place at Ibrox. The Scotland manager then highlighted recent \"big games\" such as those against Celtic and Hibernian, as well as last season's Uefa Cup final against Zenit St Petersburg, as occasions when Boyd was not deemed worthy of a starting berth.</p> <p>\"Kris has got to get his act together in terms of establishing himself at Rangers,\" Burley added. \"Walter Smith [the Rangers manager], for me, is one of the best in Britain. In the last year Kris hasn't been a regular. That tells you there is maybe something not right.</p> <p>\"I went to a World Cup with Scotland and didn't play. It is a big honour to be called up by your country. He doesn't want to play, which is very disappointing. When you are born and bred in the country and turn your back, it is a big thing.\"</p> <p>Boyd's move has given rise to speculation that others in the international setup may be unhappy with the regime and that further premature retirements may be imminent. But some senior players, though conceding that Burley's style is markedly different from those of his immediate predecessors, Alex McLeish and Smith, share his unhappiness at the forward's actions and unhelpful timing.</p> <p>Scotland currently lie second in Group Nine but their prospects of making it to South Africa in 2010 now probably rest upon gaining some reward from matches in Norway and the Netherlands. </p> <p>\"I have played at every level for my country, been a manager for 18 years at the top in Scotland and England and have managed [Ipswich Town] in Europe,\" Burley said. \"I was given the job by the Scottish FA having earned it. People can form their opinions but I have earned the right and I will do my best. Reputations won't bother me.\"</p>",
  "<p>The governments of Europe yesterday embarked on their biggest financial gamble since the launch of the euro single currency with the boldest financial rescue scheme ever seen. They are pledging to buy up tottering banks, underwrite their lending, and flood the markets with liquidity in a package that could run to a staggering \u20ac2tn in total across the EU.</p> <p>In a closely coordinated rash of announcements and observing the same rules and similar conditions, Germany, France, Austria, and Spain unveiled packages worth hundreds of billions of euros aimed at shoring up their banks and financial systems, while Italy, Sweden, Poland, and Norway prepared parallel action.</p> <p>The radical and risky moves followed an emergency summit of the 15 single currency countries in Paris on Sunday night which agreed a set of rules and instruments for the unprecedented state interventions modelled on the British government's triple-pronged strategy unveiled last week.</p> <p>The scale, ambition and potential costs of the programmes announced yesterday suggested that European leaders such as Gordon Brown, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, were determined to rise to the challenge of the financial crisis through concerted action, displaying a degree of leadership that put Washington, the global economic leader, in the shade.</p> <p>\"United Europe has pledged more than the US,\" said Sarkozy, chairing the EU, as he announced a \u20ac360bn package for France. \"European policymakers are racing ahead of the US in their efforts to solve the crisis,\" said Italy's Unicredit bank.</p> <p>Shortly after Brown explained his bailout of British banks and called for an overhaul of the global financial system, Merkel announced a \u20ac500bn rescue plan for Germany. Sarkozy followed suit. The Austrian and Spanish governments each revealed plans to make \u20ac100bn available for bank buyouts, interbank lending and bank bond issuance guarantees.</p> <p>Across the 15-country eurozone, the overall bill for the various national schemes operated according to a transnational rulebook could top a trillion euros. Factoring in Britain's estimated \u00a3500bn package as well as parallel plans in parts of Scandinavia and central Europe outside the eurozone, could take the cost for the EU's 27 states to \u20ac2tn.</p> <p>With the European taxpayer being asked to step up to the plate at a time of looming recession, and with the rescue packages signifying severe potential stress on national budgets, debt ratios, and public spending plans, it appeared that European leaders were betting their political careers on the attempt to calm and restore confidence in the financial markets.</p> <p>For the first time in weeks of panic and meltdown, there was an air of cautious optimism that Europe's response, after weeks of dithering and incohesive rhetoric, offered the best chance of stabilising a financial system careering out of control.</p> <p>\"After a haphazard start, Europe is finally getting its act together,\" said Bank of America. \"The size and nature of the national plans suggest that they could finally make a difference.\"</p> <p>Announcing a \"financial market stabilisation fund\", Merkel indicated that she was abandoning her aim of balancing Germany's budget by 2011. The German finance ministry put the scale of the German scheme at \u20ac500bn, with the bulk, as everywhere else, being earmarked to guarantee medium-term bank lending to try to jolt the banks out of their sclerosis and banish fear and suspicion. Some \u20ac70bn - with the option to top that up by \u20ac10bn - could be used to recapitalise troubled financial institutions.</p> <p>A bill implementing the plan is to be rushed through the German parliament by Friday.</p> <p>The German fund is the near-equivalent of an annual budget and comes just when the country is recovering from the mammoth costs of financing German unification over the past 15 years.</p> <p>As decided on Sunday, the loan guarantees would run until the end of next year, in Germany as well as everywhere else in the eurozone. A summit of the EU-27 tomorrow in Brussels is expected to adopt Sunday's blueprint for the entire EU. Finance ministers are to take part in the summit which will also be addressed by Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the European central bank.</p> <p>Unlike Brown and Sarkozy who have been keen to launch the series of coordinated national rescue schemes, Merkel has been sceptical for the past week. Her rhetoric on the bailouts is markedly different from the urgency being advocated by Brown and Sarkozy.</p> <p>Austria announced a \u20ac100bn scheme, of which 85% will be used to underwrite bank lending if necessary. Spain offered an identical fund to guarantee bank bond issuance, but said there was no need yet to make money available for banks recapitalisation. Italy's central bank offered to buy bank debt to the tune of \u20ac40bn.</p> <p>The banking sectors in Spain and France are believed to be the healthiest in Europe at the moment, requiring less intervention. Nonetheless, Sarkozy proposed legislation to be pushed through parliament this week allocating \u20ac360bn, \u20ac40bn of which could be used to buy up bits of ailing banks.</p>",

  "<p>A revolutionary multibillion-pound fund should be set up to pay the owners of the world's rainforests not to cut them down, a report to the prime minister will say today. The report by special adviser John Eliasch says the scheme would be a comparatively cheap way to reduce climate change emissions and would also inject vital funds into developing countries to help alleviate poverty. </p> <p>The report says that a global carbon market could pay the tropical rainforests' owners, or people living in, them to save and maintain the trees, which store carbon dioxide - the main contributor to climate change. In addition, saving the rainforests would help to control global rainfall patterns. They are also home to more than half the world's species.</p> <p>The World Bank has estimated the cost of reducing deforestation by one fifth at $2bn-$20bn (\u00a31.15bn-\u00a311.5bn) a year, leading campaigners to calculate that halting the problem would cost up to $100bn a year. </p> <p>But the Eliasch review claims countries without forests could also benefit from a global forest emission trading system, which would be relatively cheap compared with saving emissions at home. </p> <p>\"Integrating forests within a global cap and trade system would create opportunities to tackle a large part of current CO2 emissions while at the same time delivering substantial finance to forest conservation and sustainable forest management,\" says the report. \"Forest carbon finance could also make a significant impact on reducing poverty through increased financial flows to developing countries.\"</p> <p>The report marks a significant shift in the debate about saving rainforests, which has until now been dominated by charities and rich individuals - including Eliasch and the Cool Earth group he helped to set up - raising funds to buy forests, provoking outrage from some governments and local communities. </p> <p>The new model has been supported by some environmental campaigners and by the government of Guyana, which last year offered to save its rainforests in return for payments from Britain. But others warn that it would allow developed countries to avoid tackling their own emissions. </p> <p>\"These proposals offer countries the chance to buy their way out of reducing emissions through forest protection,\" said Greenpeace's head of biodiversity, Andy Tait. </p> <p>\"If relatively cheap forest credits were easily traded with other carbon units, they could 'flood' or otherwise destabilise the markets. This is likely to bring the price of carbon crashing down, reducing incentives to invest in clean and renewable energy technologies in donor countries.\"</p> <p>The Eliasch review says new research forecasts that without action to stop deforestation the problem would, by itself, generate enough carbon dioxide emissions to tip the planet over the level considered crucial to avoid more than 2C of warming. \"Consequently ... forests will need to form a central part of any global climate change deal,\" it says.</p> <p>Deforestation contributes about 17% of global carbon emissions, the third biggest source behind power generation and industry, and bigger than either China or the United States, says the report. It forecasts the pressure on forests will increase as world population grows by more than 2.5 billion people in the next 40 years.</p> <p>\"Rainforests [are] like a giant global utility right now, like a water utility or a power station, that's providing a service we're not paying for,\" said Andrew Mitchell, director of the Global Canopy Programme. \"When you don't pay your electricity bill, you get cut off. We should recognise these countries shouldn't provide us with a service [for] free.\"</p> <p>Mitchell added: \"We're saying we need to build carbon capture and storage to take the carbon out of the atmosphere and forgetting about the plants taking it out for free. We have to do both.\"</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 14 2008 to include comments by Andrew Mitchell, director of the Global Canopy Programme.</p>",
  "<p>Why do people believe they have been abducted by aliens?</p> <p>That is the question arch sceptic and professor of psychology Chris French set out to answer in a research project that began five years ago.</p> <p>Now, in a unique UK-based study to be published this month, French has come up with an intriguing explanation. Alien abductees, or \"experiencers\" as he describes them, have a different psychological profile to people who do not claim to have had these experiences, the research shows.</p> <p>Experiencers have higher levels of paranormal belief, paranormal experience, self-reported psychic ability and fantasy proneness, more vivid imaginations, a greater tendency to hallucinate and more self-reported incidences of sleep paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Search for explanations</strong></p> <p>Sleep paralysis is a scientifically accepted condition. It usually happens between sleeping and waking, when the sufferer experiences a terrifying feeling of being paralysed, unable to move or speak, while an unidentifiable horror lurks in the dark. Several of the experiencers in the study had suffered sleep paralysis and in searching for an explanation concluded they had had a close encounter, French says. \"If you have had a really vivid experience like that and you can't make any sense of it, and you come across an article or a book or a documentary that says you may well have been abducted by aliens, it gives you an explanation, and it also means you're not crazy.</p> <p>\"So we can see why some people may go for that and may then, as a consequence, end up going for hypnotic regression, already with the idea in their head that they have been abducted by aliens - and, surprise, surprise, what kind of memory then appears to surface? It's being taken on board a spaceship.\"</p> <p>Six of the experiencers had undergone hypnotic regression, which French believes can implant false memories. The research also found the abductees showed higher levels of dissociativity (a tendency to switch off or have altered states of consciousness, such as out of body experiences and missing time episodes) and absorption (an ability to lose themselves in some activity such as watching a movie or reading a novel).</p> <p>French, who is head of the anomalistic psychology research unit at Goldsmiths College, University of London, led a team of researchers who studied 19 experiencers and a control group, matched for gender and age. In each group, there were eight men and 11 women, aged between their early 20s and early 70s.</p> <p>The experiencer category included anyone who claimed to have had extraterrestrial contact. These included UFO sightings; direct contact with a variety of alien life forms as well as telepathic communication with aliens; six reported believing that the aliens had implanted some device in their bodies; one believed that his terrestrial parents were not his real parents (his real parents being extraterrestrials); two reported finding marks on their bodies caused by the aliens; and three reported that aliens had removed foetuses from them or caused them to have miscarriages.</p> <p>The participants completed seven questionnaires and were interviewed by researchers.</p> <p>The article, called Psychological Aspects of the Alien Abduction Experience, is published in the neuroscience journal Cortex. Its publication is a vindication of French's field of research, anomalistic psychology, which he defines as \"the psychology of weird experiences that people have and the beliefs that are associated with them\", and which he has pursued for more than 20 years. He also edits a semi-satirical publication, the Skeptic Magazine.</p> <p>\"I'm very used to defending my interest in this because, even now, I get the impression from certain colleagues that it's not quite a respectable thing to be interested in, even though you may have the word sceptic tattooed across your forehead.</p> <p>\"The truth is, looking at the opinion polls [see below], most people do believe in the paranormal and a sizeable minority claim to have direct personal experience. This can mean one of two things, either that paranormal forces really exist, and if that is the case, scientists should accept that and get on and study it in the same way we study and try to understand anything else. Or it's telling us something really interesting about human psychology. Either way, I think it's worth taking these kinds of beliefs seriously.</p> <p>\"One possibility is that people really are being abducted by aliens and taken on board space ships and being probed in interesting ways. I'm not convinced that the ET [extraterrestrial] hypothesis is true. So the challenge for the psychologist is to try to explain what is going on. I think the most plausible explanation is these are false memories.\"</p> <p><strong>A-level option</strong></p> <p>The profile of French's field of research is about to be raised still further following a decision by one of the biggest examination boards in the UK, the AQA, to introduce the study of anomalistic psychology as an option in the curriculum for its psychology A-level from September next year.</p> <p>French, who is writing a chapter on the subject for one of the board's psychology textbooks, is delighted his rather niche specialism will reach a wider audience in schools. \"I'm very excited about it,\" he says. \"The reason I like teaching this topic is the material is a great hook to get people interested.</p> <p>\"Whether they are believers or sceptics, most people find these claims of aliens and ghosts and strange powers interesting. Once you've got the interest, it raises all kinds of issues about the nature of evidence and what should we accept as convincing evidence, and about using it as a tool for critical thinking more generally\".</p> <p>Is French going to be turning out a generation of disbelieving sceptics? \"To be properly sceptical you have to be open to the possibility you might be wrong, and willing to be persuaded by evidence. Scepticism is not about dismissing claims before you look at the evidence. It's about saying, show me the evidence.\"</p> <p><strong>Close encounters</strong></p> <p>In a recent lecture, French cited figures from an opinion poll of a representative sample of 1,000 British adults. The figures in square brackets indicate those reporting direct personal experience of the phenomenon in question:</p> <p>\u2022 64% believe that some people have powers that cannot be explained by science [16%]</p> <p>\u2022 63% believe in God [14%]</p> <p>\u2022 52% believe in life after death [11%]</p> <p>\u2022 49% believe in ghosts [13%]</p> <p>\u2022 49% believe in precognitive dreams [19%]</p> <p>\u2022 49% believe in heaven (only 28% believe in hell) [2%, 2%]</p> <p>\u2022 47% believe in thought reading [14%]</p> <p>\u2022 41% believe in communication with the dead [9%]</p> <p>\u2022 34% believe in psychokinesis [4%]</p> <p>\u2022 26% believe in angels [ 3%]</p> <p>\u2022 25% believe in reincarnation [-]</p>",
  "<p>The best and the worst of the House of Lords were on show yesterday. Whatever Peter Mandelson's abilities, the sight of him donning ermine was a reminder of the breezy manner in which the establishment stuffs its own into the legislature, without asking the public. In debating the counter-terrorism bill, however, the upper house showed the expertise it can provide. Peers crushed the government's bankrupt scheme to lock up terror suspects for 42 days, rejecting it by a margin of 191 votes. Two hours later, the home secretary said she would drop the measure which Gordon Brown had foolishly fashioned into a political virility test.</p> <p>The decision marks the end of a drive to lock up for longer people who have been neither tried nor charged. Tony Blair's demand for 90 days' detention was defeated in 2005, but before long Gordon Brown was cooking up his own proposal to make the Conservatives look soft. He added supposed protections, such as the promise of a parliamentary vote when the powers were used. However, on inspection these were not just ineffectual but utterly confused. Almost everyone involved in fighting terror eventually resisted the proposal: prosecutors, intelligence chiefs, lawyers - and even some senior police officers. Many such professionals are in the Lords, and yesterday they made themselves heard. Even the Home Office minister Admiral Lord Alan West harboured doubts, until he was marched into No 10 to have them removed.</p> <p>Evidence, or rather the abject lack of it, was the complaint rattling through the Lords debate. The authorities have not yet dealt with a single case where the current limit of 28 days has proved inadequate. Peers refused to surrender real liberties to a hypothetical threat. The barrister Lord Lester explained the peculiar nastiness of detaining suspects in advance of charge - a point where they have few protections, and lack knowledge of the case against them. Churchill called internment \"odious\", even in the blackest hour of wartime. Today's threat is real, but hardly compares with the blitz.</p> <p>Jacqui Smith last night issued a draft bill that could reintroduce the measure rapidly at a point where it was needed. Such theatrics were a flimsy veil for retreat. The huge Lords defeat could only have been overturned using the Parliament Act, the law that lets the elected chamber assert its greater legitimacy. But when the nine votes that carried the proposal in the Commons were bought in a grubby pact with the Democratic Unionists, there was little legitimacy to assert. The outcome is humiliating for Gordon Brown, and would have been more so had finance not been dominating the news. The Lords have forced him to listen to reason and buried his poisonous proposal.</p>",
  "<p>Simon Jenkins is absolutely right: Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring does not portray an unknown \"maid's assistant\" serving as his \"secret model\" - as Tracy Chevalier recounted in her bestselling novel, made into a popular film starring Scarlett Johansson and now a London play - but rather one of Vermeer's elder daughters (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/art.theatre\">Vermeer was no sex-mad garret artist</a>, October 3). </p> <p>Nor did the painter's wife whine \"Jan, why have you never painted me?\", let alone become a \"frigid, jilted canvas-slasher\". Vermeer painted her repeatedly. As Jenkins insists, she was instead \"a beautiful woman, one of the most beguiling in all art\", who now \"lie[s] sacrificed on the altar of theatrical sex\". </p> <p>Although he remains \"unnerved by fiction's relentless abuse of history\", Jenkins assumes that \"a picture of the historical man\" would be too \"boring and hopeless for Hollywood or the West End\". His conclusion: \"Does any of this matter? Not really.\"</p> <p>I beg to differ. My book is the first to examine Vermeer's paintings in light of his biography: his early obsession with his wife as his model; the domestic attacks by her psychotic brother; the growing influence of his wealthy and zealously Catholic mother-in-law; and the coming of age of his elder daughters as his models. </p> <p>Since the time of Vermeer's \"discovery\" as an unknown genius by the French art critic Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9 around 1860, we have gradually refined our constructions of Vermeer's oeuvre and learned progressively more about his circumstances from the archives. </p> <p>Yet the most fundamental work remains to be done. In fact, it may not be the sex that attracts people to the novel, film or play, but rather the fascinating relation between Vermeer's art and life, which modern scholars have refused to address, leaving the issue to novelists or astute journalists like Jenkins. The impact of Vermeer's family life on his paintings matters a great deal.</p> <p>The real story is also much more interesting than Chevalier's fiction. I believe that seven paintings now accepted as Vermeer's work were actually painted by his eldest daughter, Maria, who was not only his model for Girl with a Pearl Earring and other works, but also his secret apprentice. </p> <p>In my view she painted Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, which Sotheby's sold to Las Vegas casino owner Steve Wynn as a Vermeer in April 2004 - Jenkins apparently made the first bid - as well as Girl with a Red Hat, an early self-portrait study, widely identified as one of her father's masterpieces. I believe she even forged some of Vermeer's paintings to pay off the family's debts to the baker. Is this story exciting and promising enough for Hollywood or the West End? I hope so. More importantly, it should interest anyone who cares about Vermeer.</p> <p>\u2022 Benjamin Binstock is author of Vermeer's Family Secrets: Genius, Discovery, and the Unknown Apprentice (to be published next month by Routledge Press) </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:bbinstock@gmail.com\">bbinstock@gmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>As everyone in the world will be aware by now, <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/04/america/simpson.php\">a Nevada state court</a> found that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/04/oj.simpson.timeline\">Orenthal James \"OJ\" Simpson</a> and Clarence \"CJ\" Stewart were guilty of, among other charges, kidnapping, robbing and assaulting two memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas casino.</p> <p>In keeping with due process, Simpson and Stewart were promised a swift and public trial with an impartial jury. Well, we all know the public trial part definitely happened. Swift is questionable, but in this day and age 13 months from start to finish is not a bad statistic for a court to cite. It's the impartial part that has me wondering: is it possible for OJ Simpson \u2013 <em>the</em> OJ Simpson \u2013 to be tried by an impartial party? Even if said party is capable of suspending preconceived notions of his previous <em>cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre</em> the moment they enter the courtroom, is it really accurate to call them impartial? Or do they retain the bias that some of them are bound to have, and simply refuse to allow themselves to act on it? Simply put: was OJ screwed from the beginning?</p> <p>I don't know anyone without strong feelings about OJ Simpson. In fact, I don't actually know anyone without a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLia4r0G63k\">verdict day</a> memory \u2013 it was that significant of an event. Personally, I was in a maths class, where we were permitted to pause the lecture for a moment so that we might listen to the decision as it was read over the radio. If I had been called to sit as a juror in Simpson's most recent case, I doubt I would have made it past the initial screening. \"Do you recall the OJ Simpson murder trial of nineteen ninety fi-\" \"HE WAS SO GUILTY, RIGHT?!\" \"You are dismissed.\"</p> <p>Done. Off to lunch.</p> <p>Allow me to clarify. I am in no way suggesting - as some have - that the Nevada jury was seeking retribution for that long-ago murder case through some sort of manipulation of the judicial system. I'm suggesting that perhaps the term \"impartial\" is a bit of a stretch. I don't buy it \u2013 a defendant of Simpsonian magnitude doesn't allow for impartiality. From the televised <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcyyCi2b2AY&amp;feature=related\">white Bronco chase</a> to \"If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit\" to the reading of the verdict to \"The Juice Is Loose,\" our country was obsessed with, even polarized by his previous trial. You were in one camp or another: innocent or guilty? Did he, or didn't he? What do you think? What's going to happen?</p> <p>It didn't help that Simpson's <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/11/08/simpson/\">latest set of charges</a> were so similar to those in his first trial. It would be a different story if he was charged with, say, littering. Or disturbing the peace. Or chaining himself to a tree to prevent loggers from destroying a rare bird's nest. These don't carry with them the same connotation as causing physical harm to another person with a deadly weapon. Again.</p> <p>Do you know what else doesn't help prevent bias for your next trial? <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/If-I-Did-Confessions-Killer/dp/0825305888\">Penning a manuscript</a> proclaiming that it wasn't you who killed your ex-wife, but if it had been, here's how you would have done it. He really didn't make this easy on himself, did he?</p> <p>The jury that convicted Simpson has been more than generous in discussing their unenviable position. Since <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-oj3-2008oct03,0,2290453.story\">court adjourned</a> 13 years to the day after Simpson was found not guilty in the criminal trial for the murder of his ex-wife and Ronald Goldman, various jurors have <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iUNgbOr-2bnpFUX0MiII6je2CkRAD93KNSJ80\">decried</a> accusations of bias. Though Simpson's lawyer now plans on <a href=\"http://www.kxnt.com/Simpson-Attorneys-Want-New-Trial/3118010\">appealing</a> the conviction partially because some of the jurors had <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-10-05-simpson_N.htm\">indicated</a> during selection that they disagreed with Simpson's acquittal in 1995, the jurors themselves have reiterated that the past was the past and did not affect their ability to do their jobs well.</p> <p>I guess I'm just a sceptic \u2013 I don't think that there are people out there who can enter into another OJ Simpson trial without recalling any of the previous ones. I'm not really sure what else could have been done \u2013 the only less partial parties than the poor souls on this jury would have had to have been imported from outside the United States, or maybe from Ye Olden Times \u2013 but when it comes to someone like Simpson, or a case like this one, I really don't see total impartiality as an option. Surely he deserves it, but he might have blown his opportunity to experience it.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/bunk_moreland.shtml\">William \"Bunk\" Moreland,</a> played by Wendell Pierce, is the rock upon which the church of Baltimore's murder police is built. Freamons and McNultys come and go, journeying from the plateaus of narcotics and major crimes, to the nadirs of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o_-1gXkJMQ\">marine patrol</a> and pawn shop detail; but the Bunk remains strictly homicide throughout all five seasons of The Wire.</p> <p>Based on the real-life detective <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_%22Rick%22_Requer\">Oscar 'Rick' Requer,</a> a pioneering black Baltimore cop in the 1960s, (who was paid the compliment of having the character of the veteran cop who trained Lester named after him in the show) Bunk plays the straight man to McNulty's wayward maverick and Lester Freamon's cerebral obsessive. But this is the Wire, and straight men come replete with \"pinstripe lawyerly affectations\", drink problems and a penchant for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdY2MnDm48w\">puss-i</a>.</p> <p>Bunk is my favourite character, one I was easily drawn to, which was pretty predictable really as I too am a man of heft, who enjoys a taste as much as the next barfly and aspires to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1h0pjVwGDI\">gilt-edged repartee</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p> Bunk: Boy, them Greeks and those twisted-ass names.<br>McNulty: Man, lay off the Greeks. They invented civilisation.<br>Bunk: Yeah? Ass-fucking, too. </p> </blockquote> <p>But it is not Bunk's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVW34_gnxu4\">sling-blade wit </a>alone that engages us, it is his understanding of the community he patrols, his ability to discriminate between career criminals and those who did what they had to do, and above all else, the detective's unwavering, unquestionable dedication to police work.</p> <p>Among the cops in the show, Bunk consistently proves himself natural police. He combines <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPrP_UAYrQ\">McNulty's bravado</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3eGITikq-Q\">Lester's clarity of thought</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOkJr7q5MuA\">Kima's street smarts</a> with a profound knowledge of human nature to follow each case from several different angles.</p> <p>Even from the first episode, Bunk is the primary in the murder of the states witness William Gant, who testified against D'Angelo Barksdale - the first act that ultimately leads to revealing the extent of Avon's organisation and the squad we come to know and love as they track him with the titular phone tap. But it is Bunk that ultimately solves the case by procuring none other than Omar Little <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbbNJx2Efbw\">as a witness</a>, fingering Avon's hitman Bird for the crime. </p> <p>In season two, Bunk, along with Lester, catches the call on 14 dead prostitutes in a \"can\" at the port, and while the guilty sailor gets away, it is this pair that eventually figure out what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EeFa8QOq_Y\">happened on that ship</a> before it docked in Baltimore.</p> <p>In season three, while the result only leads to a charge of failing to dispose of a dead animal, it is Bunk who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmHm3hrC8W0\">cracks Cheese</a> in the interrogation room, when the detail thinks they record him discussing a murder.</p> <blockquote> <p>Bunk [pretending to weep]: Boo hoo hoo\u2026 He was my dawg man, I ain't sleep since I capped his ass. Lookin' up, he be all bloody and shit. He had much love for me, even then. I ain't never gonna find another dawg like him.. boo hoo hoo<br>Cheese [genuinely weeping]: Y'all some cold-ass motherfuckers man. </p> </blockquote> <p>In season four, who else but the Bunk cracks the case of the murder of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpb4sFRrDWs\">corner boy Lex</a>, in retaliation for shooting dead Marlo's lieutenant Fruit over a girl, after appealing to his parents to speak out. The case spirals however, when Cool Lester Smooth finally figures out what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irWqo9_N4kQ\">Chris and Snoop have been doing with their victims</a>.</p> <p>And in the last season, while McNulty veers off into a vortex of self-loathing and abject ridiculousness with his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwx83J6R8II\">serial killer deception</a>, it is Bunk who ultimately gets Chris locked up for the murder of Michael's stepfather \u2013 thereby at least seeing some result from the case of the 22 bodies in the vacants, a case that plagues both the major crimes squad and homicide for practically all of season five. And he manages this in spite of a department that refuses to touch his case as it focuses its efforts on McNulty's phantom menace.</p> <p>But perhaps what marks Bunk apart as a true police is his relationship with Omar, like everything else in this eloquent programme, a complex interaction between two men and their codes of honour. </p> <p>As Omar's gang carry out another rip'n'run at a Barksdale stash house in season three, one of the crew, Tosha, gets shot. Bunk arrives at the scene and instantly recognises Omar's MO, but wrongly believes the dead girl to be a civilian. As he sees kids pretending to be Omar and replay the shootout on the street outside, the Bunk's righteous fury is ignited and he seeks out Omar.</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wmgghlEagA\">tracking Omar down</a>, Bunk not only squares up to the fearsome shotgun-wielding dervish, but pinches him in the one place he knows it will hurt \u2013 his honour. The two went to the same school and grew up in the same neighbourhood and while Omar made the best of what he could, Bunk knows he still takes some pride in being a son of the West Side. Bunk claims it was Omar's fault the girl died and that his flamboyant violence see kids emulate him, only they have no call for his precious code.</p> <blockquote> <p>As rough as that neighbourhood could be, we had us a community. Nobody, no victim, who didn't matter. And now all we got is bodies, and predatory motherfuckers like you. And out where that girl fell, I saw kids acting like Omar, calling you by name, glorifying your ass. Makes me sick, motherfucker, how far we done fell. </p> </blockquote> <p>As Omar tells Butchie later: \"The fat man's given me an itch I can't scratch.\" Omar helps Bunk and recovers the gun used to shoot Officer Dozerman to allay some of his guilt. And the favour is returned after Omar is framed by Chris and Snoop over the shooting of a delivery woman - Bunk is one of the only ones who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgURk2FLxeQ\">believes him</a> when he says he would never put his gun on a civilian. Eventually, Bunk finds the truth and gets Omar released from prison, but in return <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3nX-FAluo&amp;feature=related\">extracts a promise</a> that he will kill no more people, in a powerful scene laced with one's morality and another's regret. A promise Omar fully intends to keep - until he hears of Butchie's death.</p> <p>But when's he not being a police, Bunk is a drunk, a raucous, hilarious drunk. Unleashing easygoing banter, befogged in blue cigar smoke, perched on a bar stool screaming Jimmy's name, his crass yet sometimes effective charm with the ladies, his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMtROcoeaC4\">\"nights out\"</a> with McNulty at the railway cutting throwing back whiskey, voiding his guts <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfZRUStrX30\">outside Kavanagh's</a>\u2026 if being elected means being the guy people most want to have a beer with, President Bunk should surely only be a tipple away.</p> <p>And though he does have his darker moments, particularly his harshness on Jimmy when he tries to clean his act up, we can mostly forgive him<br>as we wanted the old Jimmy back too.</p> <blockquote> <p>Bunk: Feel like a taste?<br>McNulty: Not tonight, but you should come over for dinner sometime.<br>Bunk: [looks aghast] Dinner?!</p> </blockquote> <p>And in only the way a best friend can, he then chastises Jimmy when he does go back to his boozing and philandering ways. This, despite Jimmy's help over the years - such as extricating him <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai3R1g7UEyg&amp;feature=related\">from a woman's house </a>after a one-night stand; and the pair of them solving a case with the use of an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQbsnSVM1zM\">expletive</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>You've lost your fuckin' mind Jimmy, look at you! Half late every third night, dead drunk every second. Nut deep in random pussy. What little time you do spend sober and limp dick, you're working murders that don't even exist!</p> </blockquote> <p>But perhaps McNulty himself sums up their friendship best when in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eAPbT0iq3s\">tender, inebriated moment at the bar</a>, he tells the Bunk just why he loves him.</p> <blockquote> <p>McNulty: It's 'cause when it came time for you to fuck me, you were very gentle.<br>Bunk: You damn right.<br>McNulty: See, 'cause you could have hauled me out of the garage and just bent me over the hood of a radio car, and - no, you were, you were very gentle.<br>Bunk: I knew it was your first time. I wanted to make that shit special.<br>McNulty: It was, man. It fucking was.</p> </blockquote> <p>Whether it's his adherence to police work or his pithy one-liners you like, the Bunk is a grand element in a grand show and as with all its aspects you have to embrace his contradictions. As the man himself says: \"The job isn't about picking the stories we like best.\"<br><em><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder+wire\">Previous chats can be found at this Organ Grinder page</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\">more about The Wire can be found on our keyword page</a>.</em></p> <p><em>And if you want to see all comments on one page, just like the old days, then click on the \"all comments on one page\" link below.</em></p> <p>Do you love Bunk?

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> last night abandoned his parliamentary battle to allow police to detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days, after the Lords overwhelmingly rejected the proposal by 191 votes. In an emergency statement to MPs tonight, Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, said that the counter-terrorism bill would continue its journey through parliament without the 42 day measure.</p> <p>But in a face saving gesture, the government will publish a bill containing the 42 day plan; this bill will be held in reserve to be introduced should there be a terrorist emergency. Ministers said they had decided to follow this course because the introduction of the counter-terrorism bill would have been delayed by a year if the government had embarked on a lengthy battle with the Lords.</p> <p>\"I do not believe, as some Hon Members clearly do, that it is enough to simply cross our fingers and hope for the best,\" Smith told parliament. \"Mr Speaker, that is not good enough. Because when it comes to national security, there are certain risks I'm not prepared to take.</p> <p>Smith's announcement came after the former lord chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/terrorism-uksecurity1\">Lord Falconer</a>, dismissed the government's arguments as \"fanciful\". His comments came in a lengthy debate which ended in peers rejecting the 42 day plan by 309 to 118.</p> <p>Government sources said Brown's hand was forced because whips in the Commons told Downing Street that they would struggle to muster a majority in favour of the proposal. The 42 day plan was only passed by MPs in June by nine votes after the prime minister won the support of the nine Democratic Unionist MPs.</p> <p>If ministers had insisted on keeping the 42 day plan in the counter terrorism bill, Brown would have to have held a series of votes in the commons to overturn the Lords' rejection. The overwhelming opposition in the lords would have resulted in a game of parliamentary \"ping pong\" in which the bill would have been passed from chamber to chamber. Brown would then have had to use the parliament act to force the bill through next year.</p> <p>The announcement by the government came after Falconer told peers how he had changed his mind after supporting Tony Blair's plan to detain terror suspects without charge for 90 days in 2005. </p> <p>He had done so because police could now detain terror suspects by using the so-called \"threshold test\", an option under which they can charge a suspect on a lower threshold if they have a reasonable suspicion that evidence will be compiled in a reasonable time.</p> <p>\"It has changed in practice the basis upon which it operates,\" Falconer said. \"The idea that extending [the detention period] from 28 days to 42 days is going to make a difference is utterly fanciful.\"</p> <p>Lord West, the home office minister, warned peers of the dangers of voting against the plan. \"If we get it wrong we could all live to regret it. When the need for more than 28 days arrives \u2014 and it will \u2014 we can either have a well considered and debated back-pocket measure in place ready to make available to prosecutors, or we will be forced to release terrorists on to the streets unless some hurried legislation is passed. And we all know hurried legislation in a period of emergency is bad legislation. Whoever is in power will find it a very uncomfortable moment.\"</p> <p>Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, welcomed the government's climb- down. \"Liberty has been overwhelmed by public and parliamentary support for our campaign against the extension. Rest assured that if any government tries again we will be ready,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>To help sell his bail-out package last month, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7644265.stm\">George Bush raised the spectre of the Great Depression</a>. This was sleazy politics.</p> <p>While the country does in fact face <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2008/oct/03/useconomicgrowth?lightbox=1\">the worst financial and economic crisis since the depression</a>, there is no reason it should lead to a decade of double-digit unemployment. There is a simple way to get out of that sort of prolonged downturn: spend money. </p> <p>If the government had opted to go the route of large-scale deficit spending during the depression, it would have created jobs and provided the jump-start needed to get the economy moving again. However, this fact was not widely appreciated at the time. John Maynard Keynes's classic work, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Theory_of_Employment_Interest_and_Money\">The General Theory</a>, was not published until 1936, and it was not widely accepted until much later. </p> <p>It wasn't until the second world war forced the US government to engage in large-scale deficit spending that the economy finally got the demand boost needed to restore its normal growth pattern. Prior to that point, the people who dominated economic thinking argued that balancing the budget should be the country's top priority. This fixation with balancing the budget prompted the government to cut back spending as soon as the economy showed any signs of life, thereby heading off growth and raising the unemployment rate.</p> <p>Since we have the benefit of knowing the history of the depression, as well as the analysis of Keynes and many great economists who followed in his footsteps, we should not have to worry about repeating the mistakes that allowed the initial financial collapse in 1929 to turn into a decade-long downturn. Unfortunately, the world is not that simple.</p> <p>We do have the benefit of knowing Keynesian economics, but there are many people in positions of authority who either do not understand the importance of running deficits to sustain demand or who argue for deficit reduction regardless of the harm that it will cause the economy.</p> <p>For example, the moderators of both of the presidential debates and the vice-presidential debate asked questions that implied that the money spent on financial bail-out will require large reductions in spending and/or tax increases in the immediate future. There have been numerous <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/09/victory-within-grasp-obam_n_133346.html\">columns</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/22/AR2008092203179.html\">news stories</a> making the same point and berating the presidential candidates for not proposing big spending cuts and/or tax increases.</p> <p>And, there is the Wall Street-funded Peter Peterson Foundation with its billion dollar endowment. This outfit has been taking out full-page ads in major newspapers pushing its line that the federal government must take immediate steps to reduce the budget deficit. <br>There are many powerful members of Congress who share the Peterson Foundation's basic view of the economy.</p> <p>In short, while we now know how to prevent a decade of stagnation and double-digit unemployment, \"we\" may not be setting economic policy. It is entirely possible that the people who control economic policy will have the same views of the economy as the people who controlled the levers of power 70 years ago. If that turns out to be the case, a decade of stagnation and high unemployment is a real possibility. </p> <p>At this point, we should already be pushing ahead with a major stimulus package that focuses on helping the people hardest hit by the downturn through programmes such as unemployment insurance, food stamps and Medicaid. In addition, the stimulus package should include substantial aid to state and local governments so that they are not forced to layoff workers and cut back important programmes in the middle of a downturn. </p> <p>Since this downturn is going to be long, the package should include substantial investment components that will both boost demand in the short-term and also provide lasting economic benefits. Retrofitting buildings to make them more energy efficient would be an obvious priority, as would be repairing and improving the infrastructure by moving forward projects that are already planned. Fixing the healthcare system is another top priority that will require some additional funding up front, but will produce enormous long-term savings. </p> <p>The list of unmet needs is a long one, and a government committed to sustaining high levels of employment could see this downturn as an extraordinary opportunity to move the country forward. It remains to be seen whether we have that sort of government.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and the Democrats are stealing the election. Massive voter fraud is being carried out, even as we speak, by their henchmen, known by the innocuous sounding Association for Community Organisations for Reform Now, or Acorn. Clever bastards.<br> The only problem? Despite the screaming wall-to-wall coverage of \"Democratic voter fraud in 11 swing states\" as seen on Fox News and even the once-respectable CNN, none of it's true. None of it.</p> <p>In just the last week, we've had a phoney <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6480\">stunt raid in swing state Nevada</a> (where Acorn had been cooperating with officials for months, concerning problem canvassers they'd long ago fired); a Republican election official in swing state Missouri tell <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6487\">Fox News</a> that she's being <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6488\">beseiged</a> with fraudulent registration forms from Acorn (in a county where they've not done any registration work since August); a Republican sheriff in swing state Ohio, who, the very next day, <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6493\">suddenly requested</a> the names and addresses of hundreds of early voters (with evidence of exactly zero wrong doing, but lots of Democratic-leaning college student in the particular county, and John McCain's state campaign chair as a partner in the investigation); and a screaming front page headline <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/10092008/news/politics/nuts__132771.htm\">in Rupert Murdoch's New York Post</a> about a guy who claims he was somehow tricked by Acorn into registering 72 times (but read the article closely to note he says he registered at the same address each time, which, even if true, would allow him - you guessed it - precisely one legal vote.)</p> <p>It's an old Republican scam, but it's never been carried out with more zeal than this year. The Republicans have been putting so much time, money and resources into the propaganda leading up to this <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/ACVR\">over the last four years</a>, we should have expected no less. <br> As luck would have it, the Democrats have a man who, as an attorney years ago, actually had the temerity to join the US department of justice in representing Acorn in a successful lawsuit, forcing the state of Illinois to follow the law by allowing citizens to register to vote at the department of motor vehicles. What a scoundrel. That, of course, was before the department of justice, under George Bush's corrupt command, would itself become politicised by the very Republicans so desperate to keep low-income voters from voting, that they were willing to fire their own US attorneys for failing to bring phoney charges of voter fraud in key swing states like Nevada and Missouri. So what are the crimes that have caused all the Sturm und Drang on US television and talk radio, and in several otherwise respectable newspapers and even by the McCain campaign itself? The only actual crime here is that Acorn <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6503\">managed to register</a> some 1.3m low-income (read: Democratic-leaning) voters over the past two years. The rest is, pretty much, just made up.<br> But in the bloody and desperate trenches of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/uselections2008.civilliberties\">Republican war on democracy</a>, that's more than enough to kick in a last minute surge of lies that may - with the help of a compliant and lazy corporate US media - wreak enough havoc, scare enough voters, confuse enough people and plant enough seeds to call an Obama victory into doubt on November 4.<br> If you can't win it, steal it. If you can't steal it, claim the other guy stole it. If you can't claim the other guy stole it (yet), say they're about to and then kick up smoke that maybe someone will believe you. (Heckuva job, CNN.) Here are the facts. Acorn verifies the legitimacy of every registration its canvassers collect. If they can't authenticate the registration, or it's incomplete or questionable in other ways, they flag that form as problematic (\"fraudulent\", \"incomplete\", et cetera). They then hand in all registration forms, even the problematic ones, to elections officials, as they are required to do by law. In almost every case where you've heard about fraud by Acorn, it's because Acorn itself notified officials about the fraud that's been perpetrated on them by rogue canvassers. Most officials who run to the media screaming \"Acorn is committing fraud\" know all of the above but don't bother to share those facts with the media they've run to. None of this is about voter fraud. None of it. Where any fraud has occurred, it's voter registration fraud and has resulted in exactly zero fraudulent votes. You'll hear that Donald Duck, Mary Poppins, Dick Tracy, Mickey Mouse and (new this year) the <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/332/story/958266.html\">starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys</a> football team have all had fraudulent registrations submitted in their names. That's true. And we know this, why? Because Acorn told officials about it when they followed the law and turned in those registrations, flagged as fraudulent.<br> What you won't hear is that federal law requires anybody who does not register to vote in person at the county office to show an ID when they go to vote the first time. So, unless Donald Duck shows up with his ID, he won't be voting this November. You needn't worry, no matter how much even <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCB-wGSRzVc\">John McCain himself</a> cynically and dishonourably tries to mislead you.<br> If it quacks like a duck, in this case, it's likely another Republican Acorn voter fraud lie. They haul it out every two years.</p> <p>Just days before the 2004 presidential election, rightwing whack job Michelle Malkin claimed that Acorn was registering terrorists to vote in swing state Ohio. Problem was, <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200410270005\">that was a lie</a>.<br> In 2006, again just days before the election, the new US attorney in swing state Missouri (recently appointed, since the one before him refused to bring such charges), filed voter fraud indictments against Acorn workers in the state. Problem was, bringing election-related indictments that close to an election was a violation of the department of justice's own written policy. And Acorn had nothing to do with it, other than turning in the employees to officials. Getting the picture? It's a hoax. All of it. But it's been an effective one, as it's served to distract from very real concerns about tens of thousands of voters who have been illegally purged from the voting rolls in dozens of states, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all\">the New York Times reported</a> in a remarkable front page investigative story. That story followed a report the week before <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6453\">from CBS News</a> detailing still more wholesale purges of voting rolls in some 20 states.<br> That will be the November surprise, when thousands, if not millions show up to vote only to find they are no longer welcome to do so and are forced to vote on a \"provisional ballot\" which may or may not be counted. These real concerns of election fraud, such as voting roll purges, <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6497\">electronic voting machines that don't work</a> and so much more that actually matters, have been obscured by the smoke and mirrors and sleight of hand of the Republican party's phoney Acorn voter fraud charade.<br> And where they can, they'll parlay it all into new photo ID restrictions at the polls (knowing full well that some 20m, largely Democratic-leaning voters don't own the type of ID they'd need to jump over that next Republican hurdle.) Yet, with all of the unsubstantiated, wholly bogus claims of voter fraud being carried out by Democrats, there remains at least one case of absolutely ironclad, documented, yet still-unprosecuted case of voter fraud that, for some reason, Republicans don't much like to talk about.</p> <p>We can only <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6046\">wonder why</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The government is expected to tear up its plans to detain terrorism suspects for up to 42 days without charge after peers overwhelmingly rejected the proposal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacquismith\">Jacqui Smith</a>, the home secretary, is set to annouce plans to drop the specific proposal on detention without charge but retain the substantive part of the government's counter-terror bill.</p> <p>The move comes after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lords\">House of Lords</a> backed an amendment to block the detention plans by 309 to 118, a majority of 191, during the committee stage of the bill.</p> <p>In a face-saving measure, the government will publish separate legislation on 42 days that it will hold in abeyance in case it is ever needed.</p> <p>Although a government defeat had been widely predicted, the scale of the rebellion will be seen as a huge victory for civil liberties campaigners and will have made Smith wary of trying to force the measure through the Commons again.</p> <p>The damage to the prime minister, Gordon Brown \u2013 who as recently as this morning continued to urge peers to back the bill \u2013 may be limited by the financial crisis dominating the headlines.</p> <p>Brown has declined to say whether he would use the Parliament Act to force the legislation on to the statute books. If he did, there would probably be a prolonged period of \"ping-pong\" with peers - the process in which an amended bill is thrown back and forth from one chamber to another for repeated votes. </p> <p>If this was to end in deadlock, Brown would have to wait a year before using the Parliament Act. Campaigners against 42-day detention believe that the prime minister is not prepared for such a battle, as he cannot guarantee another Commons majority.</p> <p>Opponents of the bill claimed that any extension of the current 28-day limit for detaining suspects without charge was unnecessary and would erode civil liberties.</p> <p>Ministers argued that the increasing complexity of terror plots meant police needed more time to gather evidence.</p> <p>The measure was passed in the Commons in June by nine votes after the nine Democratic Unionist MPs supported the government.</p> <p>Since then, the number of opposition MPs has increased by two.

Markets across the globe have become increasingly unstable, and millions of Americans will open up their 401(k) statements this week and see that so much of their hard-earned savings have disappeared. </p> <p>The credit crisis has left businesses large and small unable to get loans, which means they can't buy new equipment, or hire new workers, or even make payroll for the workers they have. You've got auto plants right here in Ohio that have been around for decades closing their doors and laying off workers who've never known another job in their entire life. </p> <p>760,000 workers have lost their jobs this year. Unemployment here in Ohio is up 85% over the last eight years, which is the highest it's been in sixteen years. You've lost one of every four manufacturing jobs, the typical Ohio family has seen their income fall $2,500, and it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just \"are you better off than you were four years ago?\", it's \"are you better off than you were four weeks ago?\" </p> <p>I know these are difficult times. I know folks are worried. But I also know this \u2013 we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. Because we are the United States of America. We are the country that has faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats. And at each and every moment, we have risen to meet these challenges \u2013 not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans. </p> <p> We still have the most talented, most productive workers of any country on Earth. We're still home to innovation and technology, colleges and universities that are the envy of the world. Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities. It won't be easy, but there's no reason we can't make this century another American century. </p> <p>But it will take a new direction. It will take new leadership in Washington. It will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years. And that's why I'm running for president of the United States of America. </p> <p>My opponent has made his choice. Last week, Senator McCain's campaign announced that they were going to \"turn the page\" on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead. His campaign actually said, and I quote, \"if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose\". Well Senator McCain may be worried about losing an election, but I'm worried about Americans who are losing their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings. They can't afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to millionaires and billionaires and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. We've seen where that's led us and we're not going back. It's time to turn the page.</p> <p> Over the course of this campaign, I've laid out a set of policies that will grow our middle-class and strengthen our economy in the long-term. I'll reform our tax code so that 95% of workers and their families get a tax cut, and eliminate income taxes for seniors making under $50,000. I'll bring down the cost of health care for families and businesses by investing in preventative care, new technology, and giving every American the chance to get the same kind of health insurance that members of Congress give themselves. We'll ensure every child can compete in the global economy by recruiting an army of new teachers and making college affordable for anyone who wants to go. We'll create five million new, high-wage jobs by investing in the renewable sources of energy that will eliminate the oil we currently import from the Middle East in ten years, and we'll create two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools and bridges. </p> <p>But that's a long-term strategy for growth. Right now, we face an immediate economic emergency that requires urgent action. We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now \u2013 who don't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow, who don't know if next week's paycheck will cover this month's bills. We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle-class and we need to do it now. Today I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilise our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners. It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's spelled J-O-B-S. </p> <p>We've already lost three-quarters of a million jobs this year, and some experts say that unemployment may rise to 8% by the end of next year. We can't wait until then to start creating new jobs. That's why I'm proposing to give our businesses a new American jobs tax credit for each new employee they hire here in the United States over the next two years. </p> <p>To fuel the real engine of job creation in this country, I've also proposed eliminating all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start-up companies, and I've proposed an additional tax incentive through next year to encourage new small business investment. It is time to protect the jobs we have and to create the jobs of tomorrow by unlocking the drive, and ingenuity, and innovation of the American people. And we should fast track the loan guarantees we passed for our auto industry and provide more as needed so that they can build the energy-efficient cars America needs to end our dependence on foreign oil. </p> <p>We will also save one million jobs by creating a jobs and growth fund that will provide money to states and local communities so that they can move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads, our bridges and our schools. A lot of these projects and these jobs are at risk right now because of budget shortfalls, but this fund will make sure they continue. </p> <p>The second part of my rescue plan is to provide immediate relief to families who are watching their paycheck shrink and their jobs and life savings disappear. I've already proposed a middle-class tax cut for 95% of workers and their families, but today I'm calling on Congress to pass a plan so that the IRS will mail out the first round of those tax cuts as soon as possible. We should also extend and expand unemployment benefits to those Americans who have lost their jobs and are having a harder time finding new ones in this weak economy. And we should stop making them pay taxes on those unemployment insurance benefits as well. </p> <p>At a time when the ups and downs of the stock market have rarely been so unpredictable and dramatic, we also need to give families and retirees more flexibility and security when it comes to their retirement savings. </p> <p>I welcome Senator McCain's proposal to waive the rules that currently force our seniors to withdraw from their 401(k)s even when the market is bad. I think that's a good idea, but I think we need to do even more. Since so many Americans will be struggling to pay the bills over the next year, I propose that we allow every family to withdraw up to 15% from their IRA or 401(k) \u2013 up to a maximum of $10,000 \u2013 without any fine or penalty throughout 2009. This will help families get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college.</p> <p>The third part of my rescue plan is to provide relief for homeowners who are watching their home values decline while their property taxes go up. Earlier this year I pushed for legislation that would help homeowners stay in their homes by working to modify their mortgages. When Secretary Paulson proposed his original financial rescue plan it included nothing for homeowners. When Senator McCain was silent on the issue, I insisted that it include protections for homeowners. Now the Treasury must use the authority its been granted and move aggressively to help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes. We don't need a new law or a new $300bn giveaway to banks like Senator McCain has proposed, we just need to act quickly and decisively.</p> <p>I've already proposed a mortgage tax credit for struggling homeowners worth 10% of the interest you pay on your mortgage and we should move quickly to pass it. We should also change the unfair bankruptcy laws that allow judges to write down your mortgage if you own six or seven homes, but not if you have only one. And for all those cities and small towns that are facing a choice between cutting services like healthcare and education or raising property taxes, we will provide the funding to prevent those tax hikes from happening. We cannot allow homeowners and small towns to suffer because of the mess made by Wall Street and Washington. </p> <p>For those Americans in danger of losing their homes, today I'm also proposing a three-month moratorium on foreclosures. If you are a bank or lender that is getting money from the rescue plan that passed Congress, and your customers are making a good-faith effort to make their mortgage payments and renegotiate their mortgages, you will not be able to foreclose on their home for three months. We need to give people the breathing room they need to get back on their feet. </p> <p>Finally, this crisis has taught us that we cannot have a sound economy with a dysfunctional financial system. We passed a financial rescue plan that has the promise to help stabilise the financial system, but only if we act quickly, effectively and aggressively. The Treasury Department must move quickly with their plan to put more money into struggling banks so they have enough to lend, and they should do it in a way that protects taxpayers instead of enriching CEOs. There was a report yesterday that some financial institutions participating in this rescue plan are still trying to avoid restraints on CEO pay. That's not just wrong, it's an outrage to every American whose tax dollars have been put at risk. No major investor would ever make an investment if they didn't think the corporation was being prudent and responsible, and we shouldn't expect taxpayers to think any differently. We should also be prepared to extend broader guarantees if it becomes necessary to stabilise our financial system.</p> <p> I also believe that [the] Treasury should not limit itself to purchasing mortgage-backed securities \u2013 it should help unfreeze markets for individual mortgages, student loans, car loans, and credit card loans. And I think we need to do even more to make loans available in two very important areas of our economy: small businesses and communities. </p> <p>On Friday, I proposed [a] small business rescue plan that would create an emergency lending fund to lend money directly to small businesses that need cash for their payroll or to buy inventory. It's what we did after 9/11, and it allowed us to get low-cost loans out to tens of thousands of small businesses. We'll also make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the Small Business Administration's loan guarantee program. By temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders, we can unlock the credit that small firms need to pay their workers and keep their doors open. And today, I'm also proposing that we maintain the ability of states and local communities that are struggling to maintain basic services without raising taxes to continue to get the credit they need. </p> <p>Congress should pass this emergency rescue plan as soon as possible. If Washington can move quickly to pass a rescue plan for our financial system, there's no reason we can't move just as quickly to pass a rescue plan for our middle-class that will create jobs, provide relief, and help homeowners. And if Congress does not act in the coming months, it will be one of the first things I do as president of the United States. Because we can't wait any longer to start creating new jobs, to help struggling communities and homeowners, and to provide real and immediate relief to families who are worried not only about this month's bills, but their entire life savings. This plan will help ease those anxieties, and along with the other economic policies I've proposed, it will begin to create new jobs, grow family incomes, and put us back on the path to prosperity. </p> <p>I won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost. We'll have to set priorities as never before, and stick to them. That means pursuing investments in areas such as energy, education and health care that bear directly on our economic future, while deferring other things we can afford to do without. It means scouring the federal budget, line-by-line, ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do work more efficiently and cost less. </p> <p>It also means promoting a new ethic of responsibility. Part of the reason this crisis occurred is that everyone was living beyond their means \u2013 from Wall Street to Washington to even some on Main Street. CEOs got greedy. Politicians spent money they didn't have. Lenders tricked people into buying home they couldn't afford and some folks knew they couldn't afford them and bought them anyway. <br>We've lived through an era of easy money, in which we were allowed and even encouraged to spend without limits, to borrow instead of save.</p> <p>Now, I know that in an age of declining wages and skyrocketing costs, for many folks this was not a choice but a necessity. People have been forced to turn to credit cards and home equity loans to keep up, just like our government has borrowed from China and other creditors to help pay its bills.</p> <p>But we now know how dangerous that can be. Once we get past the present emergency, which requires immediate new investments, we have to break that cycle of debt. Our long-term future requires that we do what's necessary to scale down our deficits, grow wages and encourage personal savings again.</p> <p>It's a serious challenge. But we can do it if we act now, and if we act as one nation. We can bring a new era of responsibility and accountability to Wall Street and to Washington. We can put in place common-sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again. We can make investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the 21st century. We can restore a sense of fairness and balance that will give ever American a fair shot at the American dream. And above all, we can restore confidence \u2013 confidence in America, confidence in our economy, and confidence in ourselves. </p> <p>This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century. And future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test. Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way and its purpose? When we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession? </p> <p>Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame? When we battled back from adversity by recognising that common stake that we have in each other's success? </p> <p>This is one of those moments. I realise you're cynical and fed up with politics. I understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders. You have every right to be. But despite all of this, I ask of you what's been asked of the American people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history. I ask you to believe \u2013 to believe in yourselves, in each other, and in the future we can build together. </p> <p>Together, we cannot fail. Not now. Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save. Not when there are so many Americans without jobs and without homes. Not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor, or send their child to college, or pay their bills at the end of the month. Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves. </p> <p>We can do this. Americans have done this before. Some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe I can't go to college but my child can, maybe I can't have my own business but my child can. I may have to rent, but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own. I may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for Senate. I might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the United States of America. </p> <p>Now it falls to us. Together, we cannot fail. Together, we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eight years. Together, we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class. Together, we can create millions of new jobs, and deliver on the promise of healthcare you can afford and education that helps your kids compete. We can do this if we come together, if we have confidence in ourselves and each other, if we look beyond the darkness of the day to the bright light of hope that lies ahead. Together, we can change this country and change this world. Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless America.</p>",
  "<p>A Metropolitan police officer today admitted altering a key document about the events leading to the shooting dead of Jean Charles de Menezes.</p> <p>An official investigation was immediately launched after the admission by the officer, known only as Owen, who was the deputy surveillance coordinator on the day the Brazilian electrician was mistaken by police for a suicide bomber and killed.</p> <p>Today, Owen told an inquest he had deleted parts of a record he made about the decisions and options being considered by senior officers as De Menezes was being followed by police on July 22 2005.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, described the revelation as \"very serious\". The De Menezes family said it potentially undermined the evidence of senior officers.</p> <p>Scotland Yard said the officer would be placed on restricted duties while the investigation, by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, was carried out.</p> <p>On July 22 2005, Owen was in Scotland Yard's control room running the hunt for terrorists who had tried to bomb London the previous day. He made a computer note of what was being said by senior officers as De Menezes was followed from his south London home by surveillance officers.</p> <p>Owen told the inquest he had deleted a line in his computer notes last week. The line said that Commander Cressida Dick, the officer in charge of the operation that led to the killing of the innocent man, had at first said the Brazilian electrician could \"run onto tube as not carrying anything\".</p> <p>In her evidence to the inquest last week, Dick said she wanted the man, who police thought could be a potential suicide bomber, to be stopped before he could board a tube train.</p> <p>Owen said he had removed the line on October 7 because he \"didn't see it as relevant\". On that day, Cressida Dick was giving evidence for a second day at the inquest.</p> <p>Saying he was now not sure who had actually said \"let him run\", Owen added: \"All I can say was that one of the options was letting him run because he was not carrying anything and that there's a disagreement between management.</p> <p>\"I believe it was the commander [Dick], but when I reflected I couldn't be sure or whether she was saying this is what we are going to do or this is one of the options. It was a woman's voice.\" Owen said he mentioned the changes to a Metropolitan police solicitor the day after he submitted his evidence, on October 8.</p> <p>When asked if he was aware what he had done was very serious, he said: \"I have removed a line I believed was wrong and gave a totally false impression.\" Asked if management had told him to make that amendment, he replied: \"No. I am sure of that, sir.\" </p> <p>The full deleted line read: \"CD - can run on to tube as not carrying anything. Persuaded by U/I (unidentified) male amongst management.\"<br> After retrieving the notes, Owen said he \"flicked through\" them and saw there were a \"few mistakes\". He explained: \"The other thing I have done is delete the line I had identified as wrong and misleading when I did the statement.\"</p> <p>The home secretary said she wanted the IPCC to report \"as quickly as possible\". \"This is a very serious matter which clearly must be investigated and the facts established,\" Smith said.</p> <p>This is not the first instance in the De Menezes case of police altering evidence. On the day of the shooting, a surveillance log was altered to distance those officers who had been following the suspect from having made any positive identification.</p> <p>The original entry read: \"A split second view of his face. I believe it was [the suspect].\" The sense of this entry was reversed by the addition of two words: \"A split second view of his face AND I believe it was NOT [the suspect].\"</p> <p>Harriet Wistrich, the solicitor for the De Menezes family, said the officer's admission was significant and potentially undermined the previous testimony of senior officers: \"It is significant as another officers has been found to have altered key documents. If his document is accurate, it undermines the previous evidence of Cressida Dick and her command team.\"</p> <p>Since the tragedy, Dick has been promoted from commander to the rank of deputy assistant commissioner.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama sought to build on his commanding poll lead over John McCain today by setting out a $60bn rescue plan aimed at creating more jobs and easing the burden on US households suffering from the economic shakeout.</p> <p>In an echo of the 1930s New Deal, Obama proposed embarking on programmes to repair bridges, roads, schools and other infrastructure projects that have been on hold for decades. </p> <p>To provide immediate relief for struggling families, he suggested allowing people to dip into their retirement plans and imposing a three-month moratorium on mortgage foreclosures.</p> <p>Obama said his plan should be implemented immediately and would not have to wait until a new president takes over on January 20. </p> <p>The Democratic candidate was seeking to take control of the issue that could decide the election. Neither he nor McCain have yet put forward ideas for dealing with the financial crisis that have resonated with the electorate. Republican and Democratic analysts say that the first of the two to do so will hold the key to November 4 election. </p> <p>Obama announced his plan, worked out over the last few weeks with a battery of former treasury staff and other economic advisers, in a speech in Toledo, Ohio.</p> <p>With only three weeks left to the election, support for Obama appears to be hardening as the public blames the Republicans for the crisis. A Washington Post/ABC poll today put Obama on 53% to McCain's 43%. In a survey of scores of Republican strategists conducted by the National Journal over the weekend, 80% said they expected Obama to win, compared with only 17% three weeks ago.</p> <p>Although the polls could narrow closer to the election, especially if the stock markets rebound, McCain's campaign continues to show signs of uncertainty. In contrast with Obama's announcement of specific economic policies, McCain abandoned a plan, promised by one of his advisers, senator Lindsey Graham yesterday, to unveil proposals of his own.</p> <p>Obama, in what his campaign team billed as a major economic speech, put the emphasis on creating new jobs after the loss of 750,000 jobs this year and predictions of 8% unemployment by the end of the year. \"It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's spelled J-O-B-S,\" he said.</p> <p>To help create jobs, he is proposed a $3,000 job tax credit for every new employee a firm takes on over the next two years. He said 1m new jobs can be saved by creating a jobs and growth fund that will provide money to states and local communities to rebuild and repair roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure projects. </p> <p>He is suggesting that federal lending should be provided to help states and municipal governments embark such projects. </p> <p>In a rare acknowledgment of a good idea from the opposing camp, Obama, appealing to independents who tend to dislike partisan politics, welcomed McCain's plan for changing pension regulations so that people are not penalised by low stock market prices. \"I think that's a good idea, but I think we need to do even more,\" Obama said.</p> <p>The Democratic candidate's plan to allow people to raid their pension plans would allow families to \"get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college\".</p> <p>Opening his speech, he described the crisis as the worst since the Great Depression. \"You've got auto plants right here in Ohio that have been around for decades closing their doors and laying off workers who've never known another job in their entire life,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The government has been consistently behind the curve on the banking crisis and the chancellor's statement this morning demonstrates that it is missing the chance of turning this crisis into the opportunity of a generation to lay the foundations for <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">transforming our economy</a>. </p> <p>In <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/alistairdarling-economy\">his interviews</a> so far today the chancellor has insisted on an arms-length role for government and on returning the banks to private control as soon as possible. At a time when many British taxpayers will be losing their jobs and homes they are being asked to subsidise the banks in the bad times, simply to allow them to return to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">profiteering role</a> which caused this crisis. </p> <p>Taxpayers will want to know what they have got for their money. Under public pressure, the government has been forced into placing some limited and temporary constraints on executive pay and bonuses \u2013 and may appoint some non-executive directors. Not a lot for \u00a3500bn of public money. The government has drifted into majority or sizeable ownership of individual banks without any coherent strategy about how to use its shareholding. </p> <p>Let us be clear, the banks which the government has taken into part-nationalisation would have collapsed entirely where it not for government intervention. The billions invested today <a href=\"http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2008/10/07/we-should-have-nationlaised-banks-in-the-morning/\">surpass even the most generous estimates</a> of the banks' worth.</p> <p>The chancellor seems oblivious to the unprecedented potential the government now has to lay the foundations for transforming our economy. To give the taxpayers a return for their investment, the government should insist on an entirely restructured banking system and a new set of economic priorities for our financial institutions.</p> <p>The taxpayer, through the government, should now be forcing through an agenda with control of the board: offering full transparency and stakeholder democracy for customers and the workforce. There should also be a no-redundancies guarantee for bank workers to match the no-loss guarantee to depositors. </p> <p>A new lending strategy of these nationalised banks must prioritise tackling the worst effects of the recession. We need to promote employment through investment in major public works schemes to meet the UK's needs. We urgently need a major programme of investment in renewable energy generation to tackle climate change. Likewise we need a national programme of council house building to tackle existing housing need, and to provide a safety net for those struggling to pay rent and mortgage costs as the recession deepens.</p> <p>Such infrastructure investment would also mean large-scale job creation to arrest the rising unemployment levels. This would be a rights-based bank system, guaranteeing: </p> <p>\u0095 bank workers and customers the right to a say in how their bank is run; <br>\u0095 a right for the taxpayer to see investment that benefits their community; <br>\u0095 a right to a secure home. </p> <p>These are the opportunities the government is missing on behalf of the British public.</p> <p>The public will also not look kindly if the government continues to refuse to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/13/savings-iceland\">assist local councils</a> affected by the Icelandic banking collapse. The damage to essential local services by a forced round of cuts would be immense.</p> <p>As taxpayers are paying for this bail-out, it should be their interests that now become the focus of a programme of <a href=\"http://leap-lrc.blogspot.com/\">major structural reform</a> in the banking sector.</p>",
  "<p>A little earlier today, John McCain gave a <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/13/in_virginia_mccain_vows_an_und.html\">fiery but essentially policy-free speech</a> in Virginia, seeking to portray himself as the tough-as-nails underdog who's going to surprise his complacent -- and big-spending -- rival by surging to victory from behind. (He drew heavily on a theme that Hillary Clinton perfected towards the end of the primary season -- the implication that if you're behind in the polls, that means your supporters are somehow being slighted and ignored.) The Obama campaign <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/obama-camps-response-to-speech/\">issued a derisive statement</a> in response, noting that until yesterday McCain had been promising a set of new proposals on the economy. Shortly, in Toledo, Ohio, the Hopester is due to deliver what's been described as a \"major\" speech on the economy. I'll be liveblogging it here at <strong>1.30pm eastern, 6.30pm UK time</strong>. </p> <p><strong>1.34pm</strong>: Here he is, at the Toledo convention centre, making various preliminary remarks. Obama wants to talk about \"uncertainty in America\", but the audience keeps interrupting by telling him they love him. </p> <p>Times are tough, he begins. Factories are closing. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401K\">401ks</a> \"have become 101ks\". Unemployment in Ohio, for example, is the highest it's been in 16 years. \"It's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage or even keep the electricity on until the end of the month.\" The question isn't just whether you're better off than four years ago: it's whether you're better off than you were four weeks ago.</p> <p><strong>1.38pm</strong>: However, everything will be all right in the end because THIS IS AMERICA. But \"it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years.\" </p> <p>\"My opponent has made his choice...\" Boos from the crowd. \"No, we don't need that,\" Obama tells them. \"We just need to vote.\" (Does the Obama campaign's condemnation of McCain's negativity mean he has to try to eliminate <em>any</em> negativity from his own crowds' reactions?) He's reminding everyone of the McCain advisor who told the Washington Post that the Republicans would lose the election if they didn't shift the focus from the economy. \"Sen McCain may be worried about losing an election, but I'm worried about you losing your homes, your jobs, your life savings.\"</p> <p>And now a run through various long-held policies on tax and healthcare; nothing new so far.</p> <p><strong>1.42pm</strong>: \"If we can afford to spend $10bn a month rebuilding Iraq, we can spend some rebuilding Ohio.\" But right now we face an emergency, requiring \"urgent action.\" \"Some of you know I went canvassing just yesterday... on this single block there were already two or three foreclosed homes.\" An economic rescue plan for the middle class, right now, is what's needed. </p> <p>\"Today I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilize our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners. It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's easy to spell: J, O, B, S. Jobs.\" iPods for everyone, then!</p> <p><strong>1.46pm</strong>: \"A new American jobs tax credit\" for businesses for each American employee they hire over the next two years. And a Jobs and Growth Fund to \"save one million jobs\" by providing \"money to states and local communities so that they can move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads, our bridges and our schools. A lot of these projects and these jobs are at risk right now because of budget shortfalls, but this fund will make sure they continue.\"</p> <p><strong>1.50pm</strong>: And now the second leg of the plan, focused on savings, benefits and tax: he says he's already proposed a tax cut or 95% of people, but calls on congress to make the IRS mail out the first tranche of the tax cuts right away. \"I want to give credit where credit's due -- I welcome Senator McCain's proposal to waive the rules that currently force our seniors to withdraw from their 401ks even when the market's bad... That's a good idea, but we need to do even more. Since so many Americans will be struggling to pay the bills over the next year, I propose that we allow every family to withdraw up to 15% from their IRA or 401(k) up to a maximum of $10,000 without any fine throughout 2009, just to tide them over.\"</p> <p><strong>1.52pm</strong>: Third leg of the plan: relief for homeowners. \"Earlier this year I pushed for legislation that would help homeowners stay in their homes\" and help people avoid foreclosure. We don't need a new law, or McCain's mortgage buyout plan -- a \"giveaway to banks\". We just need action and to modify mortgage terms, he says.</p> <p>Now he proposes a three-month moratorium on home foreclosures. \"We need to give people the breathing room to get back on their feet!\" The audience liked that, a lot.</p> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong>: After a requisite bit of anti-Wall Streetery, Obama is onto a densely detailed elucidation of his \"small business rescue plan\"; there's really no comparison, detail-wise, between this speech and the McCain troops-rousing we heard earlier. \"We'll make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the Small Business Administration's loan guarantee program.By temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders, we can unlock the credit that small firms need to pay their workers and keep their doors open...\" Also, he wants to \"maintain the ability of states and local communities... to continue to get the credit they need\" to maintain basic services.</p> <p><strong>1.57pm</strong>: Let's be honest, he says: we've all been living above our means -- Wall Street, Washington, and \"some people on Main Street.\" We \"lived through an era of easy money\" -- endless loans, credit cards, etcetera. Which might have been a \"choice not a necessity\" for many, but still -- \"we know now how dangerous that can be.\" And so after the \"present emergency,\" we \"have to break that cycle of debt\", and learn to live within our means. Pretty stern stuff, almost scolding, though this audience is happy to hear it.</p> <p><strong>1.59pm</strong>: Future generations will judge America on how it responds to this crisis. Ah, the rhetorical crescendo finale begins... </p> <p>\"We can do this. We've done it before. Everybody here's got a story [of] a grandparent who said, maybe I've got to work in a dirty tough job, but my grandchild, maybe he'll be able to afford to buy his own business... maybe my child can be a congresswoman, maybe my child can be a mayor, maybe, just maybe, my child can run for the United States of America... you and I together, we're going to change the country and change the world.\" And thus he concludes. </p> <p>Everything is terrible, but everything is going to be all right.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing surprises me any more. Robert Mugabe the eloquent democrat has become a murdering monster, and will do everything he can to cling to power until the very end. Sadly, the monster retains all the intellectual faculties and abilities of the democrat. </p> <p>He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/12/zimbabwe1\">cunningly orchestrated the power-sharing deal</a> after losing the March elections and being forced by the MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai to make a sham of the June run-off. This had lost him credibility even among some African rulers. </p> <p>By engineering the deal, Mugabe forced Tsvangirai to acknowledge him as president in return for the premiership and a few cabinet seats. This regained him the right to swan around the world as the legitimate president of Zimbabwe. Ergo, he does not need Tsvangirai any more. </p> <p>But he does not want to be the one to kill the deal \u2013 as this would lose him credibility once more. So he skilfully manoeuvres things so that the MDC will be forced to walk away from the table \u2013 leaving Mugabe where he fully intended to be all along \u2013 in the driving seat. </p> <p>Despite the country collapsing around him and millions suffering from hunger and disease, there is method in Mugabe's madness. He is positioning himself for the next election \u2013 determined to reverse his humiliation at the hands of the electorate on March 29. He will never forgive Zimbabweans for rejecting him. </p> <p>This is why he has insisted on retaining control of the power ministries, while giving MDC the service ministries. He needs the police and the army, home affairs and defence ministries, to seal off the rural areas, disrupt the MDC's activities and thrash and threaten its supporters. In addition, home affairs is responsible for the conduct of elections. He needs local government to retain control of the chiefs and keep them on side. He needs information to maintain his stranglehold on the media, keeping people in the dark \u2013 as is the wont of every dictator. Access to information for millions through the publication of the mass-circulation independent weekly, <a href=\"http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/\">the Zimbabwean</a>, is what cost him the March election \u2013 according to his election agent, Emmerson Mnangagwa. </p> <p>And he needs foreign affairs to continue his world-wide campaign of hate-speech and disinformation against the west, and to continue to wag his tail for the Russians and the Chinese.</p> <p>His henchmen, the military chiefs, have a particularly vested interest in keeping control over the police \u2013 most, if not all, of them could and certainly would be arrested by an MDC-controlled police force on a wide range of charges, from crimes against humanity to theft and corruption. </p> <p>Mugabe wants the MDC, now united as Arthur Mutambara has been forced by his party to abandon his flirtation with Zanu-PF, to walk away from the deal. That's why he doesn't want Thabo Mbeki, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/southafrica\">lame-duck turned dead-duck</a> president/mediator, to come and fix it.</p>",
  "<p>The governments of Europe today embarked on their biggest financial gamble since the launch of the euro single currency by pledging to buy tottering banks, underwrite their lending and flood the markets with liquidity in a package that could cost up to \u20ac2trillion (\u00a31.5trillion) across the EU.</p> <p>In a closely coordinated rash of announcements, Germany, France, Austria and Spain unveiled packages worth hundreds of billions of euros aimed at shoring up their banks and financial systems, while Italy, Sweden, Poland and Norway prepared parallel action. </p> <p>The radical and risky moves followed an emergency summit of the 15 single currency countries in Paris on Sunday night which agreed a set of rules and instruments for the unprecedented state interventions modelled on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2008/oct/13/europeanbanks-europe\">British government's triple-whammy strategy</a> unveiled last week.</p> <p>The scale, ambition and potential costs of the programmes suggested European leaders were determined to rise to the challenge of the financial crisis through concerted action, displaying a degree of leadership that put Washington, the global economic leader, in the shade.</p> <p>\"United Europe has pledged more than the US,\" said Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president and current chairman of the EU, as he announced a \u20ac360bn package for France.</p> <p>The day began with Gordon Brown explaining his bail-out of British banks and calling for an overhaul of the global financial system. Then the German chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/germany-banks-europe\">Angela Merkel</a>, announced a \u20ac500bn rescue plan for Germany, and Sarkozy made his announcement. The Austrian and Spanish governments revealed plans to each make \u20ac100bn available for bank buyouts, interbank lending and bank bond issuance guarantees.</p> <p>Across the 15-country eurozone, the overall bill for the various national schemes could top a trillion euros. Factoring in Britain's package, estimated to cost \u00a3500bn as well as parallel plans in the parts of Scandinavia and central Europe outside the eurozone, the cost to the 27 countries of the EU could soar to \u20ac2trillion.</p> <p>It appears that European leaders are betting their political careers on the attempt to calm and restore confidence in the financial markets. For the first time in weeks of panic and meltdown, there was an air of cautious optimism that Europe's response, after weeks of dithering and incohesive rhetoric, offered the best chance of stabilising a financial system careering out of control.</p> <p>\"European policymakers are now racing ahead of the US in their efforts to solve the crisis,\" said the Italian Unicredit bank, while the Bank of America said: \"After a haphazard start, Europe is finally getting its act together. The size and nature of the national plans suggest that they could finally make a difference.\"</p> <p>Announcing a \"financial market stabilisation fund\", Merkel indicated she was abandoning her aim of balancing Germany's budget by 2011. The German finance ministry put the scale of the German scheme at \u20ac500bn, with the bulk, as everywhere else, being earmarked to guarantee medium-term bank lending to try to jolt the banks out of their sclerosis and banish fear and suspicion. About \u20ac70bn, with the option to top that up by \u20ac10bn, could be used to recapitalise troubled financial institutions. A bill implementing the plan is to be rushed through the German parliament by Friday.</p> <p>The German fund is the near-equivalent of its annual budget and comes just when the country is recovering from the mammoth costs of financing German unification over the past 15 years.</p> <p>As decided on Sunday, the loan guarantees would run until the end of next year, in Germany as well as everywhere else in the eurozone. </p> <p>A summit of the EU-27 on Wednesday in Brussels is expected to adopt Sunday's blueprint for the entire EU. Finance ministers are to take part in the summit which will be addressed by Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the European Central Bank.</p> <p>Unlike Brown and Sarkozy, who have been keen to launch the series of coordinated national rescue schemes, Merkel has been sceptical for the past week. Her rhetoric on the bail-outs is markedly different from the urgency being advocated by Brown and Sarkozy.</p> <p>Austria announced a \u20ac100bn scheme, 85% of it to be used to underwrite bank lending if necessary. Spain offered an identical fund to guarantee bank bond issuance but said there was no need yet to make money available for banks' recapitalisation. Italy's central bank offered to buy bank debt to the tune of \u20ac40bn.</p> <p>The banking sectors in Spain and France are believed to be the healthiest in Europe, requiring less intervention. Nonetheless, Sarkozy proposed legislation to be pushed through parliament this week allocating \u20ac360bn of which \u20ac40bn could be used to buy parts of ailing banks.</p>",
  "<p>It's Columbus Day here in America, and an official holiday for many workplaces. Having put in a good half day's work I'm going to head off now to engage in a certain bourgeois activity enjoyed out of doors (it's a gorgeous day, probably one of the last Indian-summer-ish days we'll have) and more often associated with Republicans. I like to be unpredictable when I can.</p> <p>I am afraid, however, that predictably enough, I have rather mixed feelings about old Chris himself. Obviously a clever navigator, but otherwise a nasty piece of work. Dick Cheney would have liked him. </p> <p>But I guess it wasn't retiring types who were inclined to sail the seven seas, then or today. In fact, check out this map of <a href=\"http://www.icc-ccs.org/extra/display.php\">pirate attacks around the world</a> just this year. Pretty stunning.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Toronto, Canada.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Vello Verder (guitar, vocals), Jon Hawkes (vocals, drums), Marc Delparte (bass, vocals).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> They formed less than a year ago, in February 2008, but already Les Gars, their name taken from the 1956 film Si Tous Les Gars Du Monde about a trawler in the North Atlantic stricken with botulism, are being highly touted, not just by actual gig-going punters but by bands - apparently, Killers, Kasabian and Editors are all big early supporters of the band. It's probably just as well that they're accruing a celebrity fanbase because the Canadian trio, who played a well-received set at last week's In The City, need the attention and, more pertinently, the money. They've just moved to London and are currently sleeping either on friends' floors or in their tour van. Not surprisingly, finding ways to live comfortably yet affordably is a major concern for them, and they clearly had work and wedge on their minds when they wrote the songs for the debut EP, which includes three-chord thrash-and-burn numbers about minimum-wage jobs, buying a house in a hostile economy and the boredom of the rat race. <br> If those sound like ingredients for the most basic, primal punk'n'roll band from 1976, that's because Les Gars could easily have propped up the bill at the Marquee on those nights when Chelsea, Eater and Slaughter &amp; the Dogs were otherwise engaged. They've lived low-rent lives: mainman Verder has in his short life been a waiter, a tree surgeon, an office worker and a fine china salesman \u2013 meaning the china was fine, not that he was particularly good at selling it. What he is quite good at is penning tunes in the dead of night: he's a bit of an insomniac who keeps a pen, paper and dictionary by his mattress ready to jot down ideas as and when they come. Hence the blurry, slurry nature of his songs about girls, booze and modern life being a bit, well, rubbish. He doesn't think girls and booze are rubbish, though. No, he likes those a lot.  And you'll like his music, if you happen to be into sloppy, ragged, rough'n'ready demo-quality garageland ramalama where the guitars, bass and drums all sound as though they are being played by drunken tramps wearing fingerless gloves and the singer sounds like he's been shouting all night. They were produced by Brian Karscig from Louis XIV and they make Towers of London sound like Shostakovich. It's nice to hear a band doing their bit, at this time of financial crisis, to keep budgets low. Their lack of sonic sophistication is positively parsimonious. There's something of the Strokes' energy in the track Haircut and a Gun (for which Verder got the idea after watching a documentary about the making of Platoon) \u2013 but the Strokes circa their dispirited and disengaged third album, not their debut - and shades of The Libertines in the slovenly She Sleeps. Nice Way to See Things borrows the riff from The Who's Who Are You but fails to take it anywhere while What I Want sounds like the Clash at their most weedy. Still, what a great cure for insomnia.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Gritty weaned\u2013on-whiskey vocals and eye-juddering bass lines that make the Vines' early stuff sound like it was made by a bunch of mummy's boys.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> They're less old-fashioned than antediluvian. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Give you a headache. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Give you botulism. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The La Physique EP is released on the band's own label on October 27. They play London's Club Zero on October 24. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> The Vines, Babyshambles, The Clash, Manic Street Preachers.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/lesgars\">www.myspace.com/lesgars</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Stars and Sons. </p>",

The MDC said it doubted mediation efforts by Mbeki this week would get Zanu-PF to compromise. </p> <p>Speaking at a rally of MDC supporters in Harare, Tsvangirai declared he was not prepared \"to compromise for the sake of compromise\".</p> <p>Threatening to withdraw from the agreement, he said: \"This struggle is about change. If we are not given the instruments of affecting change in your life, then this arrangement is stillborn.\"</p> <p>Tsvangirai told the rally he would not be pressured by Mugabe into joining an administration dominated by Zanu-PF after the opposition Movement for Democratic Change won the last reputable elections in March.</p> <p>\"If they do it that way, we have no right to be part of such an arrangement,\" he said. \"The people have suffered. But if it means suffering the more in order for them to get what is at stake, then so be it.\"</p> <p>Under the deal, Mugabe retains the presidency and chairs the cabinet while Tsvangirai, as prime minister, will head a council of ministers supervising the cabinet.</p> <p>Mugabe gazetted the appointment of new cabinet posts at the weekend, allocating his party control over the various security and intelligence forces as well as the justice portfolio and the information ministry, which controls Zimbabwe's highly partisan state newspapers and broadcasters.</p> <p>The MDC described the move as a \"giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy\", and as a ploy to pre-empt Mbeki's visit.</p> <p>\"The elite in Zanu-PF is not interested in addressing the current challenges in the country. Instead, they are obsessed with power retention at all costs,\" it said.</p> <p>The MDC said it would agree to Zanu-PF having authority over the military, but that Tsvangirai must control home affairs, which oversees the police, and the justice ministry. That is important to Tsvangirai to ensure that Zanu-PF does not repeat its violent campaign at the next election.</p> <p>Mugabe's move is a demonstration of his power to obstruct the political deal he described as \"humiliating\" after he was forced to sign it last month. But his position remains weak. There will be no foreign aid to rescue an economy collapsing under hyperinflation - officially put at 231 million per cent, but which in reality runs into the trillions - without Tsvangirai wielding real authority at the head of a genuine power-sharing government.</p> <p>Mugabe only signed the political agreement with the opposition because his administration had no solutions to the economic crisis. While he can block implementation of the deal and keep control of the government, he will be left facing even deeper problems than when he was forced into the agreement.</p> <p>Neither can Mugabe count on Mbeki to protect him. Although Mbeki remains the mediator, South Africa's new president, Kgalema Motlanthe, and those around him are hostile to Mugabe and there is a growing will inside the new government to confront the Zimbabwean leader.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu\">European Union</a> condemned Mugabe's latest unilateral move. Britain's foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a>, said Europeans would \"play no part in supporting a power grab by the Mugabe regime\".</p> <p>\"It is important that there is an international united response that says that the results of the elections need to be respected and a power grab will not be respected,\" Miliband told reporters at EU talks in Luxembourg.</p> <p>The EU has threatened to step up sanctions on Zimbabwe unless Mugabe sticks to the terms of the accord. </p> <p>\"If the agreement is not applied we shall resume our sanctions and reinforce them,\" said the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france\">France</a> currently holds the presidency of the EU. </p> <p>Existing EU sanctions include visa bans and asset freezes on top Zimbabwean officials including Mugabe.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, I got a call from a friend in Ljubljana, asking if my family and I were OK, and if we still had food and shelter. He sounded sure I had already lost my job, and offered to help. At first I did not understand what he was talking about: for the most part, life goes on as normal here in Iceland \u2013 but finally I realised he had been reading the British media. </p> <p>The British prime minister has repeatedly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/10/iceland-gordonbrown\">said that Iceland</a>, as a country, even as a nation, is going bankrupt, that our government has defaulted on its legal obligation, that we are virtually doomed \u2013 falling into an economic abyss. Neither is true. We have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/13/savings-iceland\">never denied</a> our legal obligation regarding the Icesave accounts, and the people of Iceland are not going bust. Ask yourself: would you lend \u00a3100m, as Chancellor Darling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/banking-europe\">has just announced he will</a>, to a bankrupt? </p> <p>Our currency might be in trouble and that hits us hard, our pay has been significantly devalued by rising costs, our stock exchange is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/creditcrunch-marketturmoil\">still closed</a> \u2013 but the foundations are still stable \u2013 no thanks to Gordon Brown and his menacing rhetoric of last week. And despite what is written in the London tabloids, we still go to work every day, receive our salaries, pay our bills and gather in the pub in the evenings. Today, Icelandic officials are in Moscow talking to the Russians who have offered a helping hand. The IMF is involved and many other measures are being taken \u2013 including, now, the Bank of England loan to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/iceland.banking\">Landsbanki</a>.</p> <p>Let's look at some facts, shall we? The high-flying, globetrotting business elite that came out of Iceland and started spreading borrowed money all over the UK and Europe has very little to do with the ordinary working public in Iceland. However, for some peculiar reason, the UK media thinks it is all our fault. It seems to me that you have fallen for a cruel and calculated PR stunt by Brown, whose only mission with his destructive attack on the Icelandic public was to save his miserable political life for another day. For that, the people of Iceland are paying severely. </p> <p>Yes, of course, we are angry. We are angry towards these reckless business tycoons for gambling with our good name, the most precious asset a small nation can have. But ordinary Icelanders are no more responsible for the risk-seeking businessmen who happen to hold our passport than the people of north London are responsible for the destructive behaviour of the talented Amy Winehouse. And even though most of us still enjoy most things British, we are furious with the UK government. In fact, when Brown used anti-terrorist legislation to bully Iceland's largest private firm, Kaupthing bank, into the ground, he almost made us forgive our own government, which failed to act when the troubles started to rise on the horizon.</p> <p>When the Republic of Iceland ran into the greatest troubles in its young life (it gained independence in 1944) and asked for help, none of our so-called friends stood up. The people of Iceland are paralysed by the lack of help and the destructive attack by the British PM. Iceland is an active participant in European cooperation and a founding member of Nato, but in the end, it seems Russia is Iceland's only friend. Brown's insult to Iceland will be remembered long after this \u00a3100m debt has been repaid.</p>",
  "<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an investigation today after a Metropolitan police surveillance officer admitted he had altered evidence submitted to the Jean Charles de Menezes inquest.</p> <p>The policeman, named only as Owen, told the hearing he had deleted one of his own computer notes that quoted the deputy assistant commissioner Cressida Dick - the officer in charge of operations when the Brazilian electrician was shot - as apparently concluding that De Menezes was not a security threat.</p> <p>The note said: \"CD - can run on to tube as not carrying anything\" before adding that Dick's judgement apparently came about after she was \"persuaded by U/I [unidentified] male amongst management\".</p> <p>Owen said he accessed his notes to remove the line on October 7, more than two weeks after the start of the hearing, because he \"didn't see it as relevant\".</p> <p>\"On reflection, I looked at that and thought I cannot actually say that,\" Owen told the inquest today, explaining his action. He told a Met solicitor about the changes the day after he submitted his evidence to the inquest, on October 8.</p> <p>An IPCC spokesman said the organisation had \"received a referral from the Metropolitan police service in relation to a matter arising from the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes\".</p> <p>He added: \"This matter will be subject to an independent investigation and we are not in a position to comment further at this stage.\"</p> <p>De Menezes, 27, was shot dead after boarding a train at Stockwell underground station in south London on July 22 2005 by anti-terrorism police who mistook him for a would-be suicide bomber.</p> <p>The inquest, being held at the Oval cricket ground, near Stockwell, has heard that police feared De Menezes could be Hussein Osman, one of the attackers who launched failed suicide bomb attacks on London's public transport system the previous day.</p> <p>When Dick gave evidence to the inquest last week she said she had had \"no doubt\" at the time that the right man was being targeted.</p> <p>Asked today if he was aware of the seriousness of his actions in deleting the evidence, Owen said: \"I have removed a line I believed was wrong and gave a totally false impression.\" He rejected the suggestion that senior officers had asked him to make the change, saying: \"No. I am sure of that, sir.\"</p> <p>He said he had checked through his notes and noticed a \"few mistakes\" and decided to make the amendments. Asked why, he said: \"The detail changes do not materially affect the statement.\"</p> <p>Owen said he was now not certain who had said \"let him run\" in reference to De Menezes. \"All I can say was that one of the options was letting him run because he was not carrying anything and that there's a disagreement between management,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I believe it was the commander [Dick] but when I reflected I couldn't be sure or whether she was saying this is what we are going to do or this is one of the options. It was a woman's voice.\"</p> <p>Minutes later, Owen said, Dick effectively directed the Brazilian's shooting by ordering a so-called \"hard-stop\". He said: \"A hard stop is an aggressive stop. It's not an official term but it is an aggressive stop.\"</p> <p>The inquest has heard evidence of confusion among surveillance teams detailed to follow De Menezes and ascertain whether he was, as suspected, Osman. The Brazilian lived in a south London block of flats linked by police to Osman.</p> <p>Earlier today, another senior surveillance officer, named only as Pat, denied he had told superiors that De Menezes was a confirmed terrorism suspect.</p> <p>Pat, the principal link at New Scotland Yard between surveillance officers on the ground and Dick, said the electrician was only \"possibly identifiable with\" Osman throughout the operation.</p>",

  "<p>I was listening on Friday morning to <a href=\"http://www.ex-muslim.org.uk/indexEvents.html\">a confused debate</a> in the Conway Hall among atheists and secularists about what to do about Islam. Although it was billed as organised by the Council for Ex-Muslims, the crowd of about 300 was overwhelmingly white and middle-aged and looked to me more like long-standing members of the British Humanist Association. </p> <p>On the platform were a couple of Iranian refugees who really have been threatened by a fascist theocracy; there was a Dutch defender of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali\">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>, who thought she had done entirely the right thing in moving to an <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.117,filter.all/scholar.asp\">American rightwing thinktank</a>; there was A C Grayling of this parish, who called her a friend but doubted her wisdom in going to America. From the sporadic clapping and counter-clapping, it was obvious that sentiment in the hall was deeply divided over whether home-grown fascism was a greater danger than religion. The only time these disagreements were overcome was when someone made a little speech about how no one minded religion as a private activity: it was only obnoxious when the religious tried to force their opinions on everyone else. The whole hall joined in applauding this sentiment, so obviously and unarguably right. </p> <p>Perhaps it's just my limited tolerance for high-mindedness that gave me a sudden flash of insight that this doctrine was in fact obviously and unarguably wrong. I had fight back an urge turn it on its head \u2013 to stand up and say that no one minds secularism as a private belief: only when the secularists try to force their opinions on the rest of society do they become obnoxious. </p> <p>Secularism is a doctrine about how society is best ordered. As such it cannot avoid imposing itself on those who disagree. To take two recent flashpoints \u2013 the secularists in the hall would all demand the abolition of faith schools, and an end to discrimination against gay people within religious bodies. Now, whatever you think of the merits of these proposals, they must involve interfering with people who disagree, and abrogating their freedom to act on their disagreements. Any attempt to privatise atheism in this respect, or to regard it as a forgiveable personal quirk which should have no bearing on public policy would be regarded by many atheists as an attempt at suppression, or even persecution. They would have a point. But the same point applies with equal force when made by believers.</p> <p>Religions aren't just collections of beliefs about God, or gods. They are also beliefs about humanity, and the proper ends of being human. As such, they form part of a large groups of more or less worked out philosophies: secularism, utilitarianism, feminism, even Marxism and modern liberalism. None of these can, by their nature, be wholly private doctrines. If they are true at all, they are true of everyone, and certain consequences follow for the ordering of society. </p> <p>To use feminism as an example: if someone were to say that feminism is all very well between consenting adults, but the law should not impose its conclusions on people who did not want to believe that equal work deserves equal pay, he would not only be told that he was wrong and disgusting, but that he had misunderstood the sort of claim that feminism makes of us. It is a claim about human nature: that women and men are not so different that treating them unequally is just. So it can't just be a private doctrine. Public consequences must follow.</p> <p>Comparable, if often contradictory, beliefs about human rights and duties can be read off any religion worth arguing about as well as the broad philosophies I mentioned earlier. They can't all be right, of course; but some idea of human rights and duties is necessary for any society to function; and it can't by its nature be private. </p> <p>We can, I think, reasonably demand in a liberal democracy that everyone obey the law once it has been made. But by the same token everyone is entitled to try to change the law through political means. This really does mean everyone: secularists and believers alike. Neither has the right to demand that the other keep their beliefs as a private eccentricity.</p>",
  "<p>With banks being nationalised almost daily and the national debt now soaring well over the 40% which used to be Gordon Brown's target, what about the railways? Could it not be possible to slip them back into the public sector, something that many people would love to see happen?</p> <p>There is undoubtedly a strong case to be made, since the railways may soon find themselves in financial difficulties. In recent years, passenger numbers have <a href=\"http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1528\">soared</a> and the government has let a series of franchises on the basis that revenue will continue growing at 7-8% per year. This has partly been predicated on fares rising above the rate of inflation, and partly on an expectation that passenger numbers will continue growing.</p> <p>So far there has been little sign of the impending recession, with patronage on the railways continue to increase, though at a slower rate. However, railways are very dependent on the general state of the economy and there is no doubt that passenger numbers will soon level off and start to go down. The above-inflation fares rises of 6% \u2013 with some rising by 11% \u2013 that will be imposed in January will probably be the turning point. </p> <p>That will leave the train operators, and ultimately the government, in a real pickle. Many train operators are paying heavy premiums for the right to run services and if they plunge into the red, they will do an Oliver Twist on the government. Ministers have repeatedly said that they will not renegotiate franchises and that if big operators such as FirstGroup, Stagecoach or National Express throw in the towel on one franchise, it would have to hand back all its other ones as well. In a rational world, that would be the perfect opportunity for the Department for Transport to say, sorry guys, we are going to bring the franchises back in-house and effectively renationalise the railways.</p> <p>That is to underestimate the absolute antipathy that New Labour has to nationalisation. The reluctance to step in over Northern Rock and the initial plan to take out only preference shares rather than normal stock which gives the government a say over the running of the banks in today's huge recapitalisation, demonstrates this. The recently sacked transport minister, Tom Harris, told me in an interview earlier this year that if New Labour had inherited British Rail, it would have privatised it. That was not, incidentally, the reason for his departure \u2013 being too rightwing has never been the cause of a New Labour minister's dismissal.</p> <p>In fact, what New Labour refuses to let on is that the railways are effectively largely publicly-owned anyway. <a href=\"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/\">Network Rail</a>, which owns the infrastructure, is a company without shareholders that is dependent on government backed debt (to the tune of \u00a320bn), for its survival. It receives billions in annual grants direct from government and is, to all intents and purposes, a state-run enterprise. </p> <p>Yet Peter Hain was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/12/transport-utilities\">quoted</a> at the weekend as saying that there was no question of renationalising the railways because it would be too expensive. In fact, with Network Rail already in public hands, it would cost nothing to bring back the railways under public control if the train operators handed back the franchises either when they get into financial difficulties or when their terms expire.</p> <p>Hain's dishonest argument, parroted for some time by successive transport ministers, suggests that British Rail will not emerge Phoenix-like from the ashes of the recession-hit railway system. The new transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, will undoubtedly toe the same line, but he will face a rocky time when the whole complex privatised edifice starts to fall apart as the expected growth of passengers on which it is based does not materialise.</p>",
  "<p>Since he was detained by US immigration officials in August, four storms have torn through Jean Delva's homeland. </p> <p>They wiped out roads and bridges, flooded fields and obliterated a meagre food supply. More than 850,000 people are displaced and 50,000 homes are damaged or destroyed. Hundreds died and UN officials say many more might if they don't get help.</p> <p>Sending him back would be cruel, immigrant advocates say. They and 31 members of Congress are urging the US to grant undocumented Haitian immigrants like Delva what's known as temporary protected status, allowing them to stay and work in the US legally but temporarily. </p> <p>On October 3, pushed by local activists, Haitian president Rene Preval made his first public request for TPS since the storms.</p> <p>The move, they hope, will spur the US to grant the status. It's not unheard of.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, the Bush administration announced it would extend temporary protected status to an estimated 300,000 Honduran, Nicaraguan and Salvadoran nationals who have been allowed to stay for years after natural disasters struck their countries. </p> <p>It was granted to Hondurans and Nicaraguans after Hurricane Mitch hit in 1998 and to Salvadorans after a series of earthquakes in 2001.</p> <p>While immigrant advocates argue it's unfair to deny Haiti the same benefit afforded those countries, opponents say the fact that the immigrants from those other places are still in the US is proof the system doesn't work.</p> <p>\"If Bush had ended the TPS for the Central American countries, then we would be in favour of TPS for Haitians,\" said Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, which advocates reduced immigration. \"The reason we don't is that there's no 'T' in TPS.\"</p> <p>David Abraham, a University of Miami law professor and immigration expert, said the country's mood toward immigration was much different 10 years ago. He doesn't think Preval's public statement will have an effect.</p> <p>\"This situation in Haiti has been so horrendous for so long that I don't see how additional misery would change the situation,\" he said.</p> <p>Local activists estimate there are about 15,000 Haitians here with orders to leave.</p> <p>\"I just don't know how dire conditions have to become before the US government is willing to grant Haiti this long-merited assistance,\" said Representative Alcee Hastings, a Democrat from Florida.</p> <p>The advocates argue deporting immigrants with no criminal record delivers Haitians a double blow: It cuts off income for their families here and abroad.</p> <p>\"When you deport someone to that country, all you're doing is adding another mouth to feed and cutting off support to Haiti,\" said Steven Forester, senior policy advocate at Haitian Women of Miami. </p> <p>\"If you want Haiti to get stable and get on its feet, you stop deportations so that we keep the money flowing there.\"</p> <p>US Immigration and Customs Enforcement temporarily stopped deporting Haitians last month. But that's not the same as TPS. The pause could end at any moment, and it doesn't allow undocumented immigrants from Haiti to work legally.</p> <p>Also, ICE agents continue to detain Haitians, even those like Delva - his American wife is five months pregnant. Married just three months when he was detained, he was picked up by ICE at his job before he filed his paperwork seeking residency.</p> <p>\"I respect the law. I love my family,\" Delva said from a detention centre. \"Now I have a child on the way, and I'd like to be able to help my family.\"</p> <p>For now, though, Delva waits in limbo, detained but not deported, with no resolution in sight.</p> <p>\"Everyone says America is a good country that believes in preserving family,\" his wife, Patricia Dinvil, said, rubbing her swollen belly. \"How can they tear our family apart like this?\"</p>",

  "<p>Cannabis users face new penalties when the drug is upgraded to class B from January next year, the home secretary said today. </p> <p>Jacqui Smith said that those caught with cannabis for a second time would be fined \u00a380 and after three strikes would be arrested. </p> <p>The drug was downgraded to class C in 2004, but fears over the increased use of stronger \"skunk\" strains among young people prompted a policy review and U-turn.</p> <p>Smith said she was \"extremely concerned\" about skunk, and its impact on mental health, especially if young people started to use it at an early age or \"binge smoke\".</p> <p>Skunk contains higher levels of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis.</p> <p>\"While cannabis has always been illegal, reclassifying it to a class B drug reinforces our message to everyone that it is harmful and should not be taken,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Fewer people are taking cannabis, but it is crucial that this trend continues.

  "<p>The process of rationalising our banks has begun. Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS will be in effective state ownership very soon: I have little doubt that within a short period Lloyds TSB and Barclays will follow.</p> <p>This nationalisation is essential: our economic system will collapse without it. But I stress: this has to be nationalisation, not support, for all the reasons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/11/marketturmoil-banking\">Ken Livingstone</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">John McDonnell</a> have argued. There is more than ideology in this though: outright nationalisation is needed if the government is to take control of this situation at a time when no one else can.</p> <p>All this, however, raises two questions. The first concerns how to nationalise the banks. The second is what strategy those banks should be required to adopt once in state control.</p> <p>On the first point the answer is relatively straightforward. No money must be wasted on buying out shareholders now. Every penny is needed to support the system. In that case the government should now take control of all banks requiring support by subscribing for new voting shares that give them majority control whilst designating the existing capital \"B\" shares that will have their value frozen at Friday's market price (unless it falls before the injection takes place). Those shareholders who will have their investment frozen will simply get interest on their capital at 3% in the short term \u2013 about equivalent to the rate of bank dividends.</p> <p>The government must then take immediate action to underpin the value of the banks. First it must require the banks to lend to each other. Since they will be owned in common they can now take risk on lending within the UK. There should also be full openness with the banks to be nationalised in other states. We're not in competition now. This openness would massively reduce the risk of interbank lending. The system could start again.</p> <p>Next we will require full bank cooperation in the creation of a social housing corporation to take control of properties on which there are failing mortgages. It's not just banks that need bailing out: people do to. I created <a href=\"http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2008/07/29/tackling-the-mortgage-crisis-a-real-alternative-is-possible/\">a plan</a> to do this in July this year before the need became as pressing as it now is. This will restore essential stability in one market. This is more important than toxic debt in the short term: real people with real lives need to know they will have roofs over their heads.</p> <p>After that, the banks have to re-order their priorities. Those activities that undermine the state, whether they be tax haven operations, private wealth management divisions or structured finance arms that engage solely in abusive tax planning to deny governments the cash that is now being used to bail them out, must be shut. The political signal must be sent that the world has changed and the bank model that was designed to undermine the state (as it was) is now history.</p> <p>Then the nationalised banks will have to appraise which of their activities are profitable and can still carry on without support. Insurance brokerages, domestic asset leasing companies, and even branch banking may all be profitable in their own right. If so these need to be refloated on the stock market as soon as possible for three reasons. First they do not need sorting out; second we need to restore faith in those markets and third we can use their reflotation values to effectively pay for the shares in the banks that will have been frozen on nationalisation. Shares in these new companies will be subscribed for by cancelling the value of the existing shares in issue. If done properly I have little doubt not a penny will need to be paid to existing shareholders as value is realised. I will go so far as to suggest sufficient value should be realisable to allow for the creation of new mutual organisations: the return of Halifax to the high street as a mutual does, for example, could bolster this vital part of the savings sector.</p> <p>And then the government will be left with the toxic problems including the derivatives, the more problematic banking arrangements, the hedge fund stakes, the investment banking and trading divisions that have underpinned the failure, and more. That is appropriate. First, because these are the assets that will require state support whilst the solvency issues they create are resolved.</p> <p>Second, because by the time this rump is left there will have been sufficient asset sales or reflotations for confidence to have been built in the policy of the government managing bank risk, meaning that confidence will have been established in their ability to solve these problems too.</p> <p>Third, it is in these areas of activity that radical reform of banking practices is required if further toxic activity is to be avoided, and a significant period of public ownership may be required before sufficient re-education and reformulation of banking regulation can take place to ensure that this process can be successfully undertaken. This will require, for example, a radical review of the future of the whole of western banking's approach to speculative trading, the use of hedge funds, derivatives, offshore, securitisation and many related issues such as the reporting of corporate risk, its auditing, means of incentivising those who work in banks and more. The right of a bank to even create money, as they have done without control for the last few decades, might even be questioned. The role of the mutual sector and of pensions will also need to be considered: they are integral to the long-term role of the financial sector as a whole. I do not pretend that any of these issues can be addressed in the short term and as such some time must elapse before it will be either safe or even possible to return some reformed establishments willing to engage in risk-based banking activity to the private sector once more.<br> But what is absolutely clear is that unless those who are now appointed to take control of the banks have a strategy such as this in mind, all we will be doing is giving enormous sums of money to bankers to lose, and if there is one option that is politically unacceptable, this is it. And that's why the almost total absence of comment about what we will do once the banks have been nationalised is for me one of the most worrying features of this last weekend.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>The counter-terrorism bill returns to parliament this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Click back from 3.10pm for minute-by-minute coverage.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2:53pm:</strong> It's all go in Westminster today. As the government grapples with the financial crisis, controversial legislation which aims to increase the limit terror suspects can be detained without charge from 28 days to 42 returns to parliament this afternoon almost unnoticed.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>3:12pm:</strong> Peers are expected to inflict an embarrassing defeat on the government when the counter-terrorism bill is debated at committee stage in the House of Lords. Rumour has it that the government could lose by more than 100 votes.</p> <p>Former shadow home secretary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/jun/12/daviddavis.conservatives\">David Davis \u2013 who resigned as an MP</a> to highlight the threat to civil liberties posed by the bill \u2013 yesterday described the legislation as \"dead\".</p> <p>Of course, if peers do strike out the proposal, the government still has the option of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/13/terrorism-gordonbrown\">using the Parliament Act to force it on to the statute books</a>, but the prime minister has already signalled his reluctance to do so \u2013 why court more controversy and subject your government to another tumultuous time in the Commons when you can quietly drop the proposal and retain the less controversial aspects of the bill?</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3:23pm:</strong> The debate is expected to start at about 3.10pm and the vote on the 42-day aspect of the bill will be \u2013 depending on how many peers want to speak \u2013 some time after 5pm.</p> <p>They're off. Lord Dear, a crossbencher, outlines why he has set down an amendment to the proposed legislation.</p> <p>\"The government now suggests that the 28-day limit is too restrictive,\" he said. \"They say it needs to be increased for 42-days in some circumstances.\" But Dear argues that no other country like ours has extended detention without charge to 28 days, let alone 42 days.</p> <p>\"In Canada it is only one day,\" Dear says. \"How is it that they can manage but we can't?\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3:25pm:</strong> George Foulkes, a former Labour minister and government loyalist, intervenes to ask how this tallies with Guantanamo Bay. Dear politely bats away the question.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3:33pm:</strong> The existing law is sufficient, he says, with only a slight change \u2013 for police to charge a terror suspect with a lesser offence. They could then up the offence when more evidence became available.</p> <p>\"I believe we have gone far enough [with the existing law],\" Dear says. The attempt to appear tough on terrorism is a \"shabby charade and we should reject it\".</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3:36pm:</strong> Next up is Lady Neville-Jones, the former chairman of the joint intelligence committee and shadow security minister, who describes the legislation on 42-days as \"unnecessary, undesirable and unworkable\".</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3:42pm:</strong> The safeguards the government has put in place not only make the legislation unworkable, they are also undesirable, she says.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3:45pm:</strong> Lord Thomas of Gresford, the Liberal Democrat legal affairs spokesman, reminds peers of the difficulties air passengers have faced because of the restrictions on carrying liquids. </p> <p>He goes on to list a string of trials for airline plots. \"Only three of those 24 or 25 cases resulted in a conviction and those were unrelated to the airline plot,\" he says. \"Would the outcome have been any different if they had been held for 42 days? There is no case whatsoever for suggesting 42 days will bring about a conviction when 28 days will not.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3:58pm:</strong> Lady Mallalieu, a Labour peer, says it is not a \"comfortable or happy position to find myself voting against my own party\". But she says she cannot support 42 days.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4:02pm:</strong> Foulkes interjects again to ask what is the difference in principle between 28 days and 42 days? Mallalieu says there is a difference and she will come to it shortly.</p> <p>\"These provisions are an own-goal,\" she says. Arguing that the government's proposed safeguards will have \"as much substance as the back of the envelope they were drawn up on\", she insists it will be impossible to ensure effective judicial or parliamentary oversight.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4:04pm:</strong> Mallalieu wonders what all the peers are doing there debating the issue. \"I wonder if it is for some political gain. I hope not,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Our freedoms are under threat here and for no good reason. It's time to say stop.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4:12pm:</strong> Lord Carlile of Berriew, a Lib Dem peer, says he will not vote on the legislation because of his interest in it \u2013 he carried out an independent review of British anti-terrorist laws \u2013 but he says he fears some of the arguments he has heard, prior to today, are \"disqualified from serious debate\".</p> <p>He lists some of arguments against the bill \u2013 breaching civil liberties, proposing internment, etc, and dismisses them one by one. And he accuses Lord Dear of \"misrepresenting the situation\".</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>4:18pm:</strong> Carlile then goes on to list five main reasons for supporting the bill, including the increased risk of violent terrorism, the safety of our children and the need to stay one step ahead of terrorist networks that continually regenerate themselves.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>4:20pm:</strong> Carlile says he is concerned with \"the enduring integrity of the law\".</p> <p>\"The one thing I dread is some huge event, where a plane or something is driven into a crowd, leading to thousands of deaths,\" he tells peers. \"I want to see an end to the constant introduction of new terrorism law. I want a counter-terror law that we can consolidate and that will endure.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>4:23pm:</strong> Viscount Bledisloe, a crossbench peer, interrupts to say: \"The noble Lord talks about finality and consolidation, is he really saying 42 days will solve all the problems for all time?\"</p> <p>Carlile retorts: \"No, any more than the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta\">Magna Carta</a> was available for all time, but it will do for now.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>4:30pm:</strong> Lord Elton, a Conservative peer, interjects to point out that Carlile has not answered the point that under the existing law it is possible to continue looking for evidence right up until the trial.</p> <p>Carlile says he has answered that point and ends his contribution by urging peers to back the legislation.</p> <p>\"It's what I think, it's what I believe and it's what I advise,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>4:34pm:</strong> The Earl of Onslow, another Conservative peer, argues that there is no need for the legislation because there is no increase in threat.</p> <p>Foulkes jumps to his feet again, claiming Onslow is \"manifestly wrong\" and adds: \"As are all his other remarks.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>4:38pm:</strong> Onslow sticks to his guns, prompting another interruption, this time from Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, who asks what evidence of a threat Onslow needs\u2026 \"A manifesto from Osama bin Laden?\"</p> <p>Onslow says he has asked for evidence but has not received any. \"I hope you will reject this ill-thought-out proposal,\" he adds.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>4:40pm:</strong> Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the former Lord Chancellor, then stands up and says the idea that extending the limit to 42 days would lead to more convictions was \"utterly fanciful\".</p> <p>\"If I thought extending the number of days would assist in bringing terrorists to justice then I would support it, but I do not accept it,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>4:43pm:</strong> Falconer says he agrees with Carlile about the threat level. \"There is a substantial threat to the whole community,\" he says, but extending the limit to 42 days would not help.</p> <p>\"That is why, with a heavy heart, I will vote against it,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>4:56pm:</strong> Lord Lloyd of Berwick, a crossbencher, reminds peers that the law remains 14 days and not 28 days \u2013 currently special permission from a court is required to extend detention without charge to 28 days.</p> <p>Wedderburn is up again. He says that in this complex world, police sometimes need longer to gather evidence.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4:58pm:</strong> The Conservative peer, Lord Tebbit, stands to explain why he will support the government this evening.</p> <p>He questions how <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/oct/17/humanrights.terrorism\">Falconer could support 90 days</a> \"while in office\" but not 42 days now. \"We have to take account of the fact that things are changing,\" he says. \"Victims have human rights just as much as suspects\u2026 The weight in the scales is disproportionate. </p> <p>\"Think of the dilemma if the government is denied these powers tonight, but at some time in the future a Conservative government decides that it needs them. My party might come to rue this day if they win the vote. Part of my reason for supporting the government is to protect my party at some time in the future,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>5:02pm:</strong> According to the Press Association, David Davis, the former shadow home secretary who resigned from the Commons and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/jul/11/haltemprice.daviddavis1\">fought a byelection</a> in protest to the bill, is watching the debate from the steps of the throne, inside the chamber.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>5:20pm:</strong> I should point out that it's not possible to live blog from the upper house, so I'm watching it on the BBC Parliament channel.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5:22pm:</strong> Lord Imbert, a crossbencher, says: \"Although I've heard much genuine concern about the human rights of suspects, I've not heard enough about the human rights of victims or potential victims.\" </p> <p>He says he does not accept that to request an extension, sometimes of just a few hours beyond 28 days, would be \"a recruiting sergeant for al-Qaeda\".</p> <p>\"There must be provision for a properly supervised extension to 28 days,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5:28pm:</strong> Lord Howarth of Newport, a Labour peer who used to sit on the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, sets out the realities of terrorism in today's world. </p> <p>\"The defence of the realm and safety of our citizens is the primary duty that a government has,\" he says.</p> <p>Lady Warsi, a Conservative peer, interjects to ask whether it is not more important that a majority of people feel \"part of big-tent Britain\". That would be a better long-term solution to terrorism, she suggests.</p> <p>Lord Howard says he does not want to give parliament \"excessive powers\" to erode civil liberties, but he does not think the government is overreacting in this case. The bill contains powerful safeguards and the amendment to the bill is \"ill-conceived\", he says.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>6:00pm:</strong> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale, a Labour peer and former MI6 spy, said a maximum of 28 days was \"inadequate for the threat we now face\". She said people who were \"currently, directly involved in counter-terrorism all say we need more than 28 days\". </p> <p>\"As such it [the government's legislation] deserves our support,\" she said.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>6:06pm:</strong> Lord West of Spithead, the home office minister, is now responding for the government. He says the government would not be asking for these measures if it didn't think they were needed.</p> <p>\"All of us would prefer to be in a position where a charge could be brought within 48 hours,\" he said. \"But unfortunately we are not in that position.\"</p> <p>If the police waited to act it could lead to scores or even hundreds or thousands of casualties, he says.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>6:19pm:</strong> West, a former head of the British Navy and one of the \"Goats\" brought into government by Gordon Brown under his Government of All the Talents initiative, reads his pre-written speech perfectly competently, but it doesn't sound like one of those \"from the heart\" addresses likely to sway the undecideds.</p> <p>Peers who periodically left the chamber during the debate have returned in anticipation of the vote ...</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>6:38pm:</strong> Dear gets a final go at persuading people to back his amendent 29, which would prevent the home secretary extending pre-charge detention beyond 28 days.</p> <p>And finally, they vote on amendment 29 - result soon ...</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>6:52pm:</strong> The government is defeated by 118 to 309, majority 191.</p> <p>Thanks for sticking with the debate.

  "<p>Today at 5.30pm, environmental activists, in Edwardian costume, will throng Parliament Square \u2013 and we are all invited to join them, dressed as we are. Taking inspiration from the suffragettes' \"parliament rush\" of 1908, the <a href=\"http://www.climaterush.co.uk/\">Climate Rush</a>, a legal demonstration in which some MPs will participate, seeks to press the urgency of climate change, at a time when it seems to take second place in government policy to short-term economic calculations.</p> <p>For while Gordon Brown in 2007 staked Britain's claim to <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/19/europe/EU-POL-Britain-Climate-Change.php\">world leadership</a> on climate change, describing it as \"the great project of this generation\", his government's actions are less impressive. While the climate change bill moves slowly through parliament, we have last Thursday's decision for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/stansted.airport.expansion.capacity\">extension</a> of Stansted airport after lobbying from BAA, approval for new runways at Heathrow and City airports, and hinted plans to build a new generation of coal-fired electricity plants. At the same time, the British government has made no response to either the offer by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/opinion/24sat4.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">Guyana</a> (where I was born) of trusteeship over 40m acres of virgin rain forest in exchange for modest development assistance or Ecuador's request for help so it can afford not to allow oil extraction in its corner of the Amazon.</p> <p>The irony of the proposed new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorth\">coal-fired power station</a> in Kent is that it lies in a region which will be invaded by the ocean if sea levels rise as high as feared. Few serious scientists have any doubt that burning coal and oil over three centuries drove rises in carbon dioxide levels, and with it climate change, and that we are at the brink of catastrophic change. At the poles, in the Maldives, on the coasts of England itself, the evidence is before our eyes. And the British public is aware of this: Defra's 2007 survey showed public opinion viewed the environment as among the five most urgent matters \u2013 above taxes, immigration, and pensions.</p> <p>But public opinion has long come last in state decisions \u2013 and this why the Climate Rush has chosen to wear the red suffragette sash. One hundred years on, we may all have the vote, but almost all are still among the politically excluded. The climate activists are mainly people in their 20s who marched against an attack on Iraq in 2002 and 2003, and were ignored by the majority in parliament. They have seen, most recently at the Climate Camp in August, how the \"anti-terrorism\" and \"serious crime\" legislation passed in haste in 2000 and 2005 have been used against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">peaceful protest</a>, and to distance parliament from the people. We should all share their impatience that this government, elected only by scarcely more than one-fifth of the eligible population, answer to the public on climate change.</p> <p>The tragedy of the Labour governments of 1997-2008 is that they kept the old Fabian arrogance about governing on behalf of the people, while having lost the confidence of the Webbs and Shaws, and the heroic generation of 1945, that public interest should prevail over private. For whether it is stopping the prosecution of corruption \"on the grounds of national security\" on behalf of the arms industry, linking aid to Africa to the privatisation of utilities to the benefit of water companies, or overruling planners to allow airport expansion on behalf of the aviation lobby, New Labour rarely finds a principle which it won't bend on behalf of a British corporation. In part this is because of their supine posture towards the tarnished marketist idols of the 1980s. But it is also our fault: while corporations press their interests, most citizens accept elections every few years as a substitute for democracy. Our passivity in front of parliament has made this possible.</p> <p>The Climate Rush is at once an explicit call for Britain to meet its promise to lead the global fight against climate change, and an implicit demand for the renewal of British democracy, for a parliament closer to the people. It might even be seen as in invitation for the Labour party to return to its Edwardian roots. The suffragettes, of course, were kept waiting so long for their bill by the Liberals that they ended up in the hands of the Tories: will that happen with environmentalists? See you in Westminster.</p>",

This place is fantastic for swimming, fishing, walking and diving amongst other activities. But make sure you follow the road around to the next bay for a visit. Te Ngaere Bay is a quieter and more secluded area which has lots to offer. There's easy access for boats so it's a great place to go fishing, kids will enjoy the rock pools for exploring and the beach is perfect for swimming. Allow a full day to properly enjoy the surroundings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338483729\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/10/1223653116641/nzgisbornedropin.jpg\" alt=\"Gisborne - the first place in New Zealand to see the sunrise\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gisborne - the first city in the world to see the sunrise</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.gisbornenz.com/Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Gisborne</strong><br>Posted by <strong>oceaniadawn</strong></p> <p>Gisborne is on the east coast of the North Island and is a place few tourists venture to.

  "<p>Today's big story is The Reboot. \"Fire the campaign,\" urges Bill Kristol in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/opinion/13kristol.html?ref=opinion&amp;pagewanted=print\">his New York Times column</a> (itself probably a trial balloon floated before the politico-journalistic world to gauge reaction). Nothing they're doing is working. Kristol urges the following seven steps:</p> <p>1. Run as accessible \"happy warriors,\" providing completely media access to both candidates, just as McCain 1.0 used to do.</p> <p>2. Do local radio, talk shows, town halls, anything \u2013 and invite Obama and Biden to join them.</p> <p>3. Drop the attacks, period and end of story. They aren't working.</p> <p>4. Stop unveiling gimmicky proposals designed to win that day's spin war (you know \u2013 the kind Bill Kristol <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/Kristol_McCain_should_return_to_Washington_again.html\">was wild about a few weeks ago!</a>).</p> <p>5. Make \"the substantive case for his broadly centrist conservatism.\"</p> <p>6. Remind voters that the Democrats are going to be in charge of Congress, and that Democratic control of both branches will result in a return to 1970s-style unchecked taxing and spending.</p> <p>7. Offer \"a mild mea culpa\" at Wednesday's debate about the nasty turn this race has taken.</p> <p>Well, that's five short of what alcoholics are supposed to do, but I suppose Kristol doesn't think McCain is quite that far gone. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mike Allen <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F5631627-18FE-70B2-A8A4BABCC96E84C4\">reports</a> at Politico today that McCain has retooled his stump speech. The campaign provided Allen an excerpt:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The national media has written us off. Senator Obama is measuring the drapes, and planning with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid to raise taxes, increase spending, take away your right to vote by secret ballot in labor elections, and concede defeat in Iraq. But they forgot to let you decide. My friends, we've got them just where we want them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Don't scoff. This isn't over. It's heading in the direction of being over, yes. But it's not over. Obama's leads are small enough in about six swing states that his victories there are by no means a lock. Those states are worth around 80 electoral votes, and a swing of 80 electoral votes could well mean a narrow McCain victory. That means that something big has to happen that changes the direction of the momentum in all six of those states, which would certainly be unusual. But it isn't impossible.</p> <p>So what do you do? You change direction and try to give yourself a fresh start. You talk about the other guy \"measuring the drapes\" already \u2013 a tried and true tactic. And you do some of the things Kristol suggests.</p> <p>I think Item 6 is potentially the most effective on Kristol's list. Lots of history suggests that Americans like divided government \u2013 they like a congressional check led by party B on a president of party A. Circumstances in which they happily give both the executive and legislative branches to one party are comparatively rare. Even during the \"Reagan revolution,\" Ronald Reagan never had a GOP Congress (Senate yes, for a time, but never the House). Bill Clinton had a Democratic Congress for two years, and then voters turned Congress Republican. </p> <p>So that line could work. As could others among Kristol's proposals. But I feel like there's still something missing here.</p> <p>Jackie Calmes of the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/us/politics/13plan.html?ref=todayspaper\">reported it first</a> \u2013 that, after a tense meeting between the candidate and top aides yesterday at which they were supposed to agree on some new economic proposals he would roll out this week, they emerged empty-handed. Calmes reports that the principals couldn't reach consensus on anything:</p> <blockquote> <p>The signs of internal confusion came as the campaign was under pressure from state party leaders to sharpen his message on the economy and at least blunt the advantage that Democrats traditionally have on the issue in hard times\u2026</p> <p>\u2026 Mr. McCain's policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said, \"I have no comment on anything, to anybody.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That doesn't sound like a happy fellow.</p> <p>So here, once again, we have what seems to me the same situation that has plagued his campaign since the summer. Appearance before substance. It's fine to retool speeches and promise that you're still in the fight. It's fine to open the curtain between the press section of the plane and the candidate's berth. It's fine to do all these things. And they may help. </p> <p>But if one were forced to name one reason why McCain is losing, it's that he's responded poorly, from a substantive point of view, to the current economic crisis. He put appearance before substance then, too. As I've written many times, and I'll say it again because it just gets truer and truer with every passing week: McCain built a campaign that was designed to win the wars of the daily news cycles, not the long-term battle. </p> <p>So Kristol's suggestions are fine, really. But notice that only one, Item 5, is fully about substance. </p> <p>The media will help push the reboot story line. It's superficial but it's a fact of life \u2013 the reporters want a race, and they'll gobble up a story line about \"McCain's new momentum\" if they think it'll help get their stories on page one. So McCain will benefit from that. The gap will close a little. But if McCain doesn't have stronger and more compelling things to say about the economy, the cosmetics can't save him.<br></p>",
  "<p>Today in the House of Lords <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/terrorism-gordonbrown\">I shall vote against the government's proposal</a> to increase the maximum period of pre-charge detention to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/uksecurity-labour\">42 days</a>, for exactly the same reasons that I voted against its previous proposal to increase it to 90 days. Since that vote my views have been strengthened, for reasons that I will explain.</p> <p>In 1974, I commanded my regiment on the streets of West Belfast, when internment without trial was still in existence. All internal security operations depend on intelligence, not least low-level or what is called human intelligence that results from contact with ordinary citizens. Because of internment, this was almost impossible to obtain, and we operated in an atmosphere that was hostile both to us and what we were there to do.</p> <p>In 1978, I returned to Belfast to command the brigade there, by which time internment had been lifted. The contrast in atmosphere and relationships with ordinary citizens could not have been greater. There was far greater understanding of what we were there to do, and it was possible to hold meetings with local people who mattered in some degree of normality. True, women banged dustbin lids on the pavements on the night of August 9, to remind everyone that that was the date when internment was introduced in 1971, but progress was possible without that impediment.</p> <p>To me, 42 days represents internment without trial and, having experienced the difficulties it causes to the forces of law and order, in internal security operations, I could not vote to impose similar difficulties on those who have that role on our streets today.</p> <p>I am sure that many people will have read <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141030432\">The Islamist</a> by Ed Husain, which describes very vividly how difficult life is for young Muslims in Britain today. The proposed legislation has its roots in acts of terrorism perpetrated by young Muslims, resulting in an increasingly hostile public attitude towards them.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, I attended a lecture entitled <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/events-calendar/2008-events-archive/april-2008/discussion-meeting-maajid-nawaz/\">Deflating Global Islamism</a> by Maajid Nawaz, a long-time friend and university colleague of Ed Husain who, like him, had been recruited by Hizb ut-Tahrir, (the Liberation party) an extremist Islamist organisation. He had become a national speaker and international recruiter, exporting its ideology to Pakistan and then Denmark. In 2002, immediately after 9/11, he was arrested in Egypt and sentenced to five years' imprisonment for belonging to the organisation.</p> <p>On release, he and Husain resigned from Hizb ut-Tahrir and began to write and give lectures on their ideological objections to Islamism in general and the organisation in particular, launching the <a href=\"http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/\">Quilliam Foundation</a> to further that work. After his lecture, I asked Nawaz about the impact of the 42-day proposal on young, impressionable Muslims and on organisations like Hizb ut-Tahrir. \"It's the best recruiting sergeant they could get,\" was his reply.</p> <p>So why, when it is essential to do all that we can to integrate all those who successfully apply for British citizenship into our society, should we deliberately take an unnecessary step that is likely to cause, rather than solve, the very difficulties we are trying to avoid? I am delighted that current experts such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Manningham-Buller\">Lady Manningham-Buller</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/lord_dear\">Lord Dear</a> and, most recently, the former assistant commissioner Andy Hayman, have commented that the proposals in the bill, especially the 42-day extension, are not fit for purpose. It is absolutely true. I can only suppose that those responsible for the proposal have not thought through the practical implications for those whose job it is to maintain law and order, or for members of the public with whom, to keep that order, they must maintain good relationships.</p>",
  "<p>To walk into Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster's new installation at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/tate-modern-turbine-hall\">Tate Modern</a> is like walking into a sci-fi movie - a deeply disturbing, rather dark experience in which you the viewer project your own narrative and your own anxieties on to the piece. And, I suspect, with TH.2058 (as it is called), Tate has another Turbine Hall hit on its hands. Not only does it have at its heart the kind of \"interactivity\" that is so popular among visitors to Tate Modern, but also, with its apocalyptic vision, it seems deeply in tune with the times.</p> <p>At the bottom of the ramp your path is blocked by heavy red and green plastic curtains and the insistent sound of rain. You are about to be transported 50 years into the future, you are told. Push the plastic barriers aside and you are in some kind of bunk-bed-filled disaster shelter - somewhere between Henry Moore's drawings of communal air-raid shelters in the blitz and the nightmarish dormitories of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVpN312hYgU\">Soylent Green</a> or Blindness, or of certain scenes in Battlestar Galactica.</p> <p>On the bunks sit books - things like Fahrenheit 451 and The War of the Worlds - which distance you from the disaster-bunker fiction, but might also give you the chance for a peaceful 45 minutes on your back doing some background reading. Most grippingly, enormous sculptures soar above you. They look oddly familiar - isn't that Louise Bourgeois's Maman, the huge steel spider that's in the Tate's collection? Only ... it's much bigger than you remember it, and when you walk up to it and feel its cold surface, you suddenly realise you are feeling warm painted polystyrene. There's a vast Alexander Calder here too - his soaring red Flamingo - again bigger than real life. And an oversize Bruce Nauman, and a giant Henry Moore. It is as if they have grown (the insistent rain has fed these strange animals, perhaps, or we have diminished). It seems no coincidence that some of the sculptors here have been responsible for previous Turbine Hall installations. On a giant screen at the front of all this is a montage of sci-fi movies: clips from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/94711/solaris\">Solaris</a>, Repulsion, Zabriskie Point and more. The Last Film, it's called. As if when the world ends we'll be watching it going down in fiction.</p>",
  "<p>We're at the point where we're obsessed with the visible manifestations of the campaign right now \u2013 the stump speeches, the ads, whether the Bill Ayers attacks are working. But let's step back and consider something that isn't immediately visible, something that might have a big impact on how this race winds down. In a word, money.</p> <p>Two questions you may not have thought about in the past week: How much money is Obama probably raising right now, and how much are the Republicans raising?</p> <p>Obama will announce his September totals next week. He raised a record <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/14/obama-raises-66-million-i_n_126259.html\">$66m in August</a>. Doesn't it seem safe to say that the September number will be north of that? Maybe $75m? And what about the October figure? He could hit $100m in a single month. Even if that proves high, the guesstimate of another $75m or so, a more conservative projection today, would have seemed mind-blowing a few months ago.</p> <p>You could tell last week that Obama was swimming in cash when his campaign announced that it had <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/09/barack-obama-buys-half-ho_n_133363.html\">purchased 30-minute blocs of air time during prime time</a> on three different networks. Every indication is that he could practically buy the whole week on a network if he wanted to, but the big shows are starting their new seasons. As much enthusiasm as he's generated, he's still probably no match for Grey's Anatomy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the GOP side\u2026McCain, remember, accepted public financing for the general election, which Obama did not, so McCain gets his money from the federal government. He and his party can, however, raise money that goes technically not to him but to the party. It can't be spent on campaign travel and payroll, but it can be spent on television advertising, mailings and other activities that support the presidential ticket.</p> <p>I should think they had a strong September \u2013 remember, McCain was ahead for the first half of September, until the financial crisis hit. But how must they be doing now? In all likelihood, not nearly as well.</p> <p>McCain's campaign is now at the point \u2013 seven, eight points behind with just three weeks remaining; also, unsure of its message and direction \u2013 where the political pros in the party start making choices. They look at the amount of money the party is bringing in. They look at the state of McCain's campaign and start making sober calculations about the chance of his winning. </p> <p>Then, they size up the races for Senate and the House of Representatives. They start telling themselves things like, \"Well, okay, maybe we lose the presidency. But we've got to keep the Democrats from getting 60 senators. We've got to try to hold on in <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2008/Senate/Maps/Oct12-s.html\">North Carolina, Minnesota and Oregon</a>.\" And as far as the House of Representatives goes, <a href=\"http://www.electionprojection.com/house08.shtml\">momentum is still moving in the Democrats' direction</a>. They may pick up 12 seats, which would give them a hefty 61-seat advantage. </p> <p>Republican operatives want desperately to recapture control of that body. And they know very well that every 10 or so seats you're behind there adds another two or four years to the project. So they have a very strong interest in trying to keep losses there to a minimum.</p> <p>So, with fewer resources at their disposal than the Obama campaign, the Republicans are going to have to start making choices. My hunch is that McCain has a week to show that he can break through in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/#data\">Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida (65 electoral votes all told)</a>. He's slightly behind in Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, and somewhat more than slightly behind in Virginia. </p> <p>If McCain can show by next weekend that he's nudged the needle in these states in his direction, his campaign managers will probably be able to persuade the party's money people to keep the infusions coming. </p> <p>But if he can't, history shows that they'll start cutting their losses and moving their spending to the protection of congressional incumbents. As you read blind quotes from GOP operatives over the next few days, keep an eye out for hints of this.<br></p>",

  "<p>Does the government's sudden enthusiasm for public ownership extend beyond the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking\">banking sector</a>? </p> <p>I am interested to know whether the decision to take control of two of Britain's leading banks is the start of rolling back the Thatcherite orthodoxy of private good, public bad. </p> <p>And if we can <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/13/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">pay \u00a337bn towards partially nationalising the banks</a>, what else we should bring back under state control?</p> <p>The Labour government stepped back from re-nationalising the rail network going instead for a halfway house in Network Rail. But public ownership has increased the cost of running the railways threefold and trains remain relentlessly overcrowded. </p> <p>Then again, we should ask whether the privatised utilities such as power and water have really been run in the best interests of consumers in recent years. Private power companies have pushed up prices sharply in the past couple of months and had their arms twisted to find help for the fuel poor. However, on the continent, where state ownership is the norm, prices have not risen so quickly.</p> <p>Again there is the post office, which is an often-loved institution among the public. The government seems determined to shutdown the bulk of a network that extends into all corners of Britain - into places that many banks have given up on years ago. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/creditcrunch-banking\">John Cruddas suggests in the Guardian today</a>, we could use the network to extend banking and other services to many people who otherwise miss out.</p> <p>The public mood has certainly soured towards the banks, but will it extend to these other areas of the economy? If we are in for the sort of deep recession the economists are predicting, perhaps public policy goals can best be met by holding some key industries in state hands. </p> <p>It is time for Labour traditionalists to re-assert themselves. Public ownership is not the big evil it has been painted and can play a very useful role.</p>",
  "<p>Lancashire have axed Stuart Law after a single season as captain, informing the Australian veteran that he will not even be offered a new contract for 2009 and appointing the stalwart seamer Glen Chapple as his successor.</p> <p>The county have admitted that Law's contract with the rebel Indian Cricket League, which could jeopardise their ability to participate in any future Twenty20 Champions League tournaments, was a factor in their shock decision.</p> <p>But they insist that it was the club's desire to look to younger players that led to Law, who turns 40 next week, being shown the door so soon after Dominic Cork - a decision which Law blasted at the time, claiming that he had not been consulted and muttering about the decision being taken by men drinking gin and tonic in the committee room.</p> <p>Lancashire's chief executive Jim Cumbes said: \"Stuart has been a top class player and has served us superbly in the time he has been here, but the club is committed to giving younger members of the squad the opportunity to grow and the Cricket Committee felt the time was right for other players to take on added responsibilities.</p> <p>\"Although not a determining factor, any player's allegiance to the ICL does make it difficult for English counties, simply because the ECB [England &amp; Wales Cricket Board] are tightening regulations on unauthorised competitions, as are the ICC [International Cricket Council].\"</p> <p>Mike Watkinson, Lancashire's cricket manager, said; \"Stuart was one of my very first signings when I took over, and has always given tremendous service to the club. He is a quality player who takes great pride in passing on his knowledge to anyone who needs a helping hand. He is highly-respected in the dressing room and popular with both members and supporters. We wish him and his family all the best for the future.\"</p> <p>Law joined Lancashire from Essex in 2002 and scored almost 12,000 runs for the county in all competitions. After several seasons as vice-captain to Mark Chilton he took over last winter but was not able to end Lancashire's long wait for a major trophy, as after a promising start they faded from championship contention and ended up scrambling to avoid relegation.</p> <p>Perhaps significantly, Chapple played the single most significant part in securing their safety with a stunning six-wicket burst to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the decisive game against Kent at Liverpool. The 34-year-old is the club's longest serving player, having made his first-class debut back in 1992, although he has never held any captaincy aspirations and only led the team for the first time because of an injury crisis late in the season.</p> <p>\"I'm absolutely delighted and very proud to be named as captain of Lancashire,\" he said. \"It's a privilege to play for such a big county, and an even bigger honour to be captaining the club I've been involved with for the past 18 years.\" </p>",

  "<p>The government thinks that your time is worth nothing. At least, that's the implication of this written answer in the Commons last week.</p> <p>The UKip MP, Dr Bob Spink, <a href=\" http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-10-09a.224311.h&amp;s=speaker:11245+section:wrans#g224311.q0\">asked the environment secretary</a> \"what estimate he has made of the average time per year spent by a household in sorting and recycling rubbish.\" An important question of course, for that time spent sorting items to be recycled is obviously a cost of such recycling schemes. The answer came back from Jane Kennedy, minister of state in the department, \"No such estimate has been made\".</p> <p>An answer that means that, quite simply, we do not know whether recycling is a good idea or not. For we don't in fact know whether it costs us more to do it than we save by doing it ... for those who have imposed it upon us have not considered one of the major costs associated with doing it.</p> <p>Starting from the very beginning: your time has a value. This isn't restricted to your working hours either: the time you spend cuddling your inamorata, building a model railway or in contemplation of a pint of Old Wallop has a value to you. That is why you do these things, because you value them. If, by law, we are going to insist that you give up some of that time, to do something we tell you to do, we need to value the time you're being forced to give up. Quite what value we can put on it is a little fraught. It might be that \u00a310 an hour, something like the average wage across the country, is the right number. It might be \u00a35.73 an hour, for that is the minimum wage, the figure below which it is illegal for you to sell your time. But it is some cash amount per hour, for you yourself have already decided that you'd prefer the cuddling, modelling or contemplation rather than working that extra hour for such a sum.</p> <p>We'd also like to know how many hours you are being asked to give up to aid in the recycling effort, thus the question asked above. I've received a similar response when asking the same department directly: they don't know because they've never bothered to consider the point. There's almost no academic research on this either, the amount of time it takes to prepare to recycle. The best I've been able to find is something <a href=\" http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/603wxcce.asp?pg=2\">from Seattle</a>, showing that it takes a household 16 minutes per week for a simple programme and 45 minutes for one including food and garden waste. We have some 24 million households in the UK, so for a simple system we're asking everyone to give up 6 million hours a week or around 300 million a year. At minimum wage this is a \u00a31.8bn minimum cost of such a system. At the longer estimate of hours for a more complex system and using the average wage, we have a cost of \u00a39bn. These are the numbers we now need to plug into our cost benefit analysis of whether we should in fact be recycling.</p> <p>Now don't get me wrong, I'm not against all recycling: no one who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timworstall\">bought and sold scrap metal</a> for a living would be so stupid as to say that none of it makes sense. But we do need distinguish between things it is sensible to recycle and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/oilandgascompanies.taxandspending\">things that it is not</a>. Steel, aluminium, copper, yes, clearly so, these make profits even when all of the costs are included and profit is the market's way of working out whether you are in fact adding value in a process. There are also other factors that we might want to include on our benefits side, things that aren't taken account of in market pricing. Say, perhaps, the methane given off from landfills, even the aesthetics of landfills themselves. Fine, add away: then we can work out whether recycling a particular product in a particular way actually makes sense or not. We assign values to all of the costs and to all of the benefits, tot them up and if B is higher than C then it's a good idea. If C is higher than B then it's a bad one for it makes us poorer by doing it.</p> <p>It's also true that wittering on about \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/10/economics.climatechange\">saving resources</a>\" doesn't get around this point. For time itself is a resource, one with a value as above. Indeed, it's not a difficult argument to make that time is the only truly non-renewable resource that we have and thus one that we really don't want to waste.</p> <p>Now I agree that there's a little of tilting at windmills to all of this. Our targets for recycling aren't actually something in the power of our own government to alter. They are fed to us from Brussels, for matters environmental are a sole competence of the European Union. Local councils will be fined if they don't meet the targets and there's an end to the matter. </p> <p>However, a few more numbers. We were told in the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ENVIRONMENT/WASTE/strategy/review/index.htm\">Waste Not, Want Not report</a> that waste disposal was costing us \u00a31.6bn a year and that if we didn't do something this could rise to \u00a33.2bn. We thus needed to recycle more and reduce this cost \u2026 but hang on; recycling more also imposes this huge cost of our time. So are we in fact saving resources at all by pushing out our plans to recycle ever more of our waste? Or are we in fact consuming more resources than we're saving?</p> <p>Here at Cif there are enough environmental and green type authors whose knowledge and brains we can pick. I'm perfectly happy to agree that the numbers I've used for the valuation of our time are back-of-the envelope stuff: however, they're the only attempt so far that anyone has made at all for the UK, as above, even the government hasn't tried to calculate them. So the labour cost alone of a simple recycling scheme is some \u00a31.8bn a year and of a more extensive one, of the type being rolled out, is perhaps \u00a39bn a year. I would say that this is vastly more than any benefits that we receive from that process. It's greater than the resources saved, it's greater than any environmental benefit, greater than any reduction in transport or emissions, greater than any rational calculation of what we get back for what we're being forced to put in.</p> <p>So how about it? Caroline Lucas, George Monbiot, Oliver Tickell, Mark Lynas, Tony Juniper \u2013 there are enough people around here who should be able to prove me wrong. How much time is required to recycle, how should that time be valued, what are the benefits (valued in money please, so that we can compare costs with benefits), whether those benefits are environmental or more direct and, finally, show us that the benefits are greater than the costs. Please do add in CO2 savings for example, using the Stern review's estimate of social cost.</p> <p>And no, saying that we've a new state religion and that we should all be required to worship Gaia for an appropriate time each week won't cut it. Anyway, it should be easy to provide these numbers \u2013 even though the government clearly hasn't done a proper cost benefit analysis, surely those urging us all to recycle more will have done so \u2013 won't they?</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes, heroes come in the most unprepossessing of guises. Last year, Sydney Norton, 86, of New Cross, south London, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7663471.stm\"> smothered Betty</a>, his wife of 57 years, while she was being treated as a patient in Lewisham Hospital.<br> Betty had suffered a stroke in 2000 and more recently had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Sydney had refused the help of social services \u2013 but even if he hadn't, experience says the aid given would have been chronically short of what he required.</p> <p>Last week, Judge Brian Barker, commons sergeant of London, told Norton, \"I am totally convinced you are a thoughtful, kind and honest man and had been a devoted husband \u2026 Society may understand this act but it cannot condone it.\"</p> <p>Sooner or later, \"society\" is going to have to get its backside off the fence. Understanding but not condoning creates a state of total hypocrisy. And injustice. What if Betty had been smothered not by her husband, in his 80s, but by, say, a niece in her late 20s \u2013 out of love and concern for her aunt. Would the court have shown the same leniency?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=117&amp;Itemid=166\">Dignitas</a> is a Swiss assisted suicide (euthanasia) group that helps those with incurable physical and mental illnesses to die with the aid of doctors and nurses. Swiss laws on assisted suicide hold that a person who assists in an assisted suicide can only be prosecuted if they are motivated by self-interest.</p> <p>According to the charity <a href=\"http://www.dignityindying.org.uk \">Dignity in Dying</a>, since Dignitas was established 10 years ago, none of the relatives of the 92 British people who have made use of the organisation have been prosecuted. Many have been questioned by the police and some have had to wait several months before their case was eventually dropped. </p> <p>In theory, a person risks a prison sentence of up to 14 years for aiding or abetting a suicide. Earlier this month, 45-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/19/health.immigrationpolicy\">Debbie Purdy</a>, who has a progressive form of multiple sclerosis, launched a two-day judicial review at London's high court in an attempt to force the Crown Prosecution Service to spell out exactly what actions would lead to a friend or relative <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3123290/Debbie-Purdy-demands-Director-of-Public-Prosecutions-spell-out-law-on-assisted-suicide.html\">being charged</a> under the 1961 Suicide Act. Purdy has accused the director of public prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, QC, of \"cowardice\" for refusing to give guidance on the law. When it comes to discussions around the one aspect of life we share in common, namely the end, we all display some degree of cowardice. The mystery is \u2013 why?</p> <p>In an effort to challenge this taboo, a small charity in Australia, <a href=\"http://www.pilotlight.org.au\">Pilotlight</a>, founded by British-born Jane Tewson, co-founder of Comic Relief, has published a beautifully produced booklet, <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/shop/productdetails/0,22028,22768902-29582,00.html\">Dying to Know</a>. </p> <p>Drawing on consultations with friends and relatives, palliative care workers, people with terminal illness, undertakers, philosophers and others, Dying to Know frames a conversation about the nature of living and reality of dying in a way that is engaging rather than depressing. </p> <p>We need a similar publication here and a lot more besides. In the US state of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/usa-healthandwellbeing\">Oregon</a>, for example, assisted suicide has been legal for a decade. Only once we start talking about death realistically, can we can begin to think about it a touch more openly and rationally.</p> <p>Dying to Know quotes, among others, Jean de la Fontaine: \"Death never takes a wise man by surprise. He is always ready to go.\" Ready to go perhaps, but whether he is allowed to go is another issue altogether.</p> <p>The Christian right imply that legalised euthanasia will result in a mass cull. Euthanasia is against this group's moral code and they obviously have a right to their beliefs. But that doesn't mean the choice should be denied all.</p> <p>The government recently announced a 10-year <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_086277\">End of Life Care Strategy</a> for England. It will <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article4347656.ece\">allow the terminally ill</a> more choice over whether they die at home or in hospital. Medical staff will be given better training. Palliative care will be improved. </p> <p>The budget, however, is infinitesimal and, more importantly, unless the context in which these discussions and negotiations take place is drastically altered, a reluctance to talk about one's exit from this world will continue \u2013 not least for fear of upsetting loved ones; yet more hypocrisy. </p> <p>In June, Dignity in Dying published a charter for dignity at the end of life. Its 10 points include the opportunity to create an end of life care plan and the right for terminally ill, mentally competent adults to have an assisted death.</p> <p>Has there been much debate around the issue? Barely a whisper. It's ironic that while we can come up with endless euphemisms around death (passing away, croaking, kicking the bucket, pushing up daisies etc etc) we mostly remain mum about the business of taking our final bows. And yet, often, it's the one thing that doesn't look after itself; not unless you are very, very lucky.</p> <p>In the case of Norton, of course, he wasn't following his wife's wishes. He was performing what is known as a \"mercy killing\". And like others who have followed a similar path, he was given a suspended sentence by the court.</p> <p>Those accused usually plead guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. Again this a sham, since some relatives, out of love/pity/respect, have to weigh up the consequences for themselves and others very carefully before they kill. It could be the most responsible act of their lives. </p> <p>My father has Alzheimer's and a couple of times now he has been brought back from the brink by the well-intentioned actions of physicians anxious to \"cure\" his pneumonia and numerous other infections. Why?</p> <p>My dad never discussed what he would wish to happen in the event of him falling prey to a disease that reduces its victims to the condition of babies. </p> <p>What I do know is that many times, as he grew older, he would say that if he lost his freedom and his independence, life wouldn't be worth living. Both are long gone, yet, still, I lack Norton's courage. </p> <p>Once my memory had gone; my speech destroyed (and every person will have a different threshold), I would want to be \"put to sleep\", in the language of those tiptoeing around father time, out of fear that \u2013 what? He might unexpectedly strike? </p> <p>However, in strange limbo that now exists in which euthanasia happens but we pretend it doesn't, by asking my children to lend me a hand, I run the risk of turning them into criminals.

  "<p>A clampdown on bankers' pay forms a key part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">government's \u00a337bn banking rescue package</a> announced today.</p> <p>At the same time the Financial Services Authority slammed the pay schemes of many firms for being \"inconsistent with sound risk management\".</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/banking-economy\">a weekend of frantic negotiations</a> which continued through last night, the Treasury announced a wide-ranging rescue plan under which bank bosses face a crackdown on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/executivesalaries\">pay and bonuses</a>, and shareholder dividends will be axed.</p> <p>Across the economy, there were \u00a31.5bn more bonuses paid during the main bonus season this year than in the previous year, the Office for National Statistics said today. That compares with increases of \u00a33bn in both 2006 and 2007. While bonus growth in the financial services sector was broadly flat, it accounted for about 60% of all payments between December and April.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Business/pdf/2008/10/13/dear_ceo.pdf\">FSA added its weight to the clampdown on executive pay in the City and wrote to the heads of UK banks</a>, warning that \"bad\" remuneration policies were not acceptable in the current climate and urging them to review their pay policies.</p> <p>\"There is widespread concern that inappropriate remuneration schemes, particularly but not exclusively in the areas of investment banking and trading, may have contributed to the present market crisis,\" the financial watchdog wrote. \"The FSA shares these concerns. It would appear that in many cases the remuneration structures of firms may have been inconsistent with sound risk management.\"</p> <p>The government insisted that bank directors would no longer walk away with large payoffs, with Gordon Brown telling a press conference that \"rewards for failure\" would no longer be tolerated.</p> <p>Both Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB said today that directors who are dismissed will receive \"a severance package which is reasonable and perceived as fair\". </p> <p>RBS's chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, who picked up \u00a34.2m last year, and chairman Sir Tom McKillop are both stepping down. Goodwin has an \u00a38.4m pension pot that will pay him \u00a3579,000 a year when he reaches retirement age. Brown said he understood that Goodwin, who is being replaced immediately, would not be receiving a severance package. McKillop retires from the board next April.</p> <p>RBS has said it would look at both executive pay and bonuses in the financial trading rooms where its problems originated. Barclays - whose president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/11/executivesalaries.survey\">Bob Diamond made \u00a318.1m</a> last year and collected another \u00a314m from a three-year performance plan shortly after the year end - is also believed to be reviewing its directors' pay arrangements.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/guardianexecutivepaysurvey\">survey by the Guardian</a> found that the chief executives of Britain's five largest banks were paid almost \u00a365m over the last five years and their pay has risen far faster than inflation.</p> <p>The FSA said it has already held a number of high-level discussions with London-based firms about their remuneration policies, and intends a further round of visits before the end of the year to gather more specific information. The watchdog will publish its findings early next year, without naming individual firms.</p> <p>In its initial thoughts on \"good\" pay policies, the FSA said bonuses should be calculated on the basis of profits and other business goals, rather than revenues. They should take proper account of a range of risks including liquidity risk. Executives' performance ought to be assessed on a moving average of results, rather than just the current financial year. Rather than being calculated solely on the basis of financial performance, bonuses awarded should also reflect risk management skills and adherence to company values.</p> <p>Moreover, the FSA said the fixed component of the pay package should be large enough to meet the employee's main financial needs; there ought to be an appropriate mix of cash and shares or share options; and a major proportion of the bonuses should be deferred. Firms' remuneration committees should be mainly composed of non-executive directors and have effective control of pay policies. </p> <p>Alistair Darling, the chancellor, said today's rescue package was necessary in the \"extraordinary circumstances\" affecting markets worldwide.</p> <p>\"I'm determined to do everything we can to stabilise our banking system and make it stronger,\" the chancellor said. \"And in return for it, of course, there will be restrictions on what happens in boardroom pay and we're also getting guarantees in relation to increased lending to businesses, as well as to mortgages too.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was the weekend that the increasingly negative tone of the election race finally caught up with John McCain. After days of growing unease about the hatred his campaign might be whipping up with its personal attacks on Barack Obama, the Republican was forced to confront his own supporters: on Friday, he seized the microphone from one woman who said she feared Obama because \"he's an Arab\", and told the crowd that his rival was \"a decent person that you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States\". The most scathing criticism of the McCain campaign came from John Lewis, a Democratic congressman and civil rights icon from Georgia, who said the climate reminded him of the incendiary speeches of Alabama governor George Wallace and the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, Ed Pilkington writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/uselections2008-johnmccain\">today's Guardian</a>. \"Because of [the] atmosphere of hate,\" Lewis said, \"four little girls were killed on a Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama.\" McCain called it a \"brazen and baseless attack\", but seemed to be toning down his rhetoric.</p> <p>The question was whether he could find a strategy to replace it with. There were signs of rising panic among senior Republicans, several of whom told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/us/politics/12strategy.html\">New York Times</a> they felt McCain was not connecting with voters. Within the campaign, the Associated Press reported, \"from junior aides to top advisers, the frustration is palpable\". But on one topic at least, the McCain campaign seemed determined to put a cheerful face on things. Late on Friday, an investigation into the so-called \"troopergate\" scandal had determined that Sarah Palin violated a state ethics law when she pressured Alaska's chief of police to sack her brother-in-law, a state trooper, though it ruled that her subsequent decision to fire the police chief was lawful. Palin's version: that the finding meant she'd been \"cleared of any legal wrongdoing or unethical activity at all,\" something she said she greatly appreciated.</p> <p>As you may recall, there is another candidate in this election. He spent the weekend campaigning in Ohio, where a new poll had him closing in on McCain. And it seemed that the Clintons, after a decidedly lukewarm few weeks, were finally throwing their weight behind him: they both campaigned alongside Joe Biden this weekend in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Biden was born and where Hillary Clinton's father grew up. They'll follow up with more events this week.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>McCain and Palin focus their efforts on Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania today, and how negative they choose to get will be closely monitored. They're also due to attend their final joint fundraiser tomorrow, in Manhattan, reportedly seeking to raise $5m. Obama will be in Ohio today, with Biden in New Hampshire and Delaware - and the spotlight is beginning to turn to Hempstead, on Long Island, where Obama and McCain will meet on Wednesday for their final debate.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama's lead over McCain was slightly reduced in Gallup's daily tracking poll yesterday, from 51%-42% to 50%-43%; likewise, Rasmussen had the candidates on 51%-45%, one point down from Obama's lead the previous day, which was 52%-45%. A Newsweek poll has Obama leading 52% to 41%, and shows he now leads McCain among men, women, and every age group of voters, including those over 65, though McCain still leads among independents, 45% to 43%.</p> <h2>Quote of the weekend</h2> <p>\"After I whip his you-know-what in this debate, we're going to be going out 24/7.\" John McCain at the weekend, proving that there are some things to which he will not stoop - for example, saying the word \"ass\".</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip\">Follow the Guardian's US road trip from LA to Washington</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/uselections2008-johnmccain\">McCain tones down campaign as critics say tactics incite hatred</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/uselection-vote-florida-obama\">Young make 'great schlep' to persuade a sceptical generation to vote Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/12/uselections2008-barackobama\">Stryker McGuire: The election is not in the bag.

  "<p>Photographs released by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/korea\">North Korea</a> purporting to show Kim Jong-il making a recent public appearance could in fact be months old, reports said today, increasing speculation that the communist state's leader has suffered a stroke.</p> <p>North Korean state television broadcast a series of still images on Saturday showing a seemingly healthy Kim inspecting a women's military unit. </p> <p>They were the first supposedly new images of the leader for two months, a period during which he failed to attend some major state events.

I don't think that is necessary.\"</p> <p>Britain currently has 4,100 troops in Iraq, with Gordon Brown expected to cut that number significantly next year in moves towards a more diplomatic presence. </p> <p>Maliki said a status of forces agreement between the British and Iraqi governments, which would provide legal cover for any British troops serving in the country after a UN security council mandate expires on December 31, had yet to begin.</p> <p>He criticised a secret deal struck between Britain and the Mahdi army, Iraq's largest Shia militia group, in which British forces were withdrawn from Basra palace last year. </p> <p>The prime minister described the decision to withdraw as \"premature\", saying the Iraqi government viewed it as the start of a \"disaster\" that saw violence sweep the southern city.</p> <p>\"They stayed away from the confrontation, which gave the gangs and militias the chance to control the city,\" he added.</p> <p>Catastrophe was only averted after thousands of Iraqi troops regained control and \"sacrifices\" were made, he said, describing the current situation in Basra as \"very good\".</p> <p>Maliki hit out at the decision to stop mortar and rocket attacks on the Mahdi army, which he said had been taken without consulting Baghdad.</p> <p>Despite the criticisms, he stressed that he looked forward to a continued relationship with Britain. </p> <p>\"The Iraqi arena is open for British companies and British friendship, for economic exchange and positive cooperation in science and education,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked whether he enjoyed his job, Maliki said: \"Never.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was a strange event. At a closed conference in the Uzbek capital on media freedom this month, speaker after speaker depicted Uzbekistan as a veritable paradise of free speech. Ordinary Uzbeks might have been surprised to hear it. Those who try to tell the truth in Islam Karimov's country are liable to be thrown behind bars. </p> <p>In some ways even more disturbing, however, is the fact that <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/uzbekistan/index_en.htm\">European policymakers</a> seem ready to treat the empty rhetoric as though it represents real change. At a meeting of EU foreign ministers today, some want to cite this Alice in Wonderland meeting as proof that Uzbekistan is moving in the right direction. The failure to distinguish between words and deeds is a cocktail of cynicism and naivete. Uzbekistan has indeed made a few minor concessions in response to limited international pressure in the past year, including the release of a handful of human rights defenders, in a bid to stave off the renewal of targeted sanctions. But its repressive approach remains fundamentally unchanged \u2013 not because of too much pressure, but too little.</p> <p>Take the case of journalist <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/09/11/uzbeki19795.htm\">Salijon Abdurakhmanov</a>, who this week received a 10-year jail sentence for drugs charges. Most observers agree that his real crime is that he addressed human rights and justice issues in his writing. <a href=\"http://nasir-khan.blogspot.com/2008/09/free-uzbek-human-rights-activist-akzam.html\">Akzam Turgunov</a>, a human rights defender and opposition activist now on trial, suffered from severe burns after scalding water was poured down his back. (The UN notes that torture in Uzbek custody remains \"<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2007/11/23/uzbeki17406.htm\">routine</a>\".) Even outside the country's borders, Karimov's critics are not safe. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, Alisher Saipov, an independent Uzbek journalist who wrote for the website <a href=\"http://enews.ferghana.ru/\">ferghana.ru</a>, was murdered last year; before his death, official Uzbek media branded him \"a traitor\". <br> Ask Uzbekistan's embattled human rights activists if they believe things are getting better, and the answer is an unequivocal no. But European governments, eager to co-opt Uzbekistan as an ally once more, are impatient to reach a different conclusion (Germany, for example, has an air base in Uzbekistan, a staging post for Afghanistan). </p> <p>In 2005, the European Union imposed limited sanctions, including an arms embargo and a visa ban for senior officials, after a massacre in the eastern town of Andijan. After armed insurgents seized several government buildings, Uzbek troops opened fire on crowds, the overwhelming majority of them unarmed, slaughtering hundreds. As documented in a Human Rights Watch <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/campaigns/andijan/\">report</a> published immediately after the massacre, the killing was calculated. After the main shooting was over, soldiers fired bullets point blank into the heads of some of those who survived the first onslaught. Those who speak of the massacre, or even those whose crime is to have witnessed it, have been hunted down and arrested. </p> <p>Uzbekistan has from the start portrayed the massacre as a justified response to a terrorist uprising. European governments initially rejected that obvious lie. Now, however, they have begun to suggest that the cold-blooded slaughter of large numbers of civilians needs to be seen in \"perspective\". That perspective appears to be: look the other away. </p> <p>Some diplomats argue that the very fact that Human Rights Watch and a few other non-governmental organisations working on Uzbekistan were \u2013 at the request of the European Commission \u2013 allowed to speak at the conference is a significant step forward. And yet the Uzbeks made that concession in the hope that it would deflect the pressure for any real change. It would be absurd to reward them for the inconvenience of listening to the truth for a few hours. </p> <p>Real change is nowhere to be seen. For all the talk at the conference of the burgeoning internet, the Human Rights Watch <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">website</a> is blocked, as are other websites which report on the reality of life in Uzbekistan. Human Rights Watch has had a presence in Tashkent for more than a decade; this year, our Uzbekistan researcher was told that he can no longer work in the country. </p> <p>Confronted with these facts, Uzbek speakers at the conference continued blithely with yet another presentation on the marvels of life under Islam Karimov, or complained at the rudeness of visitors who dared cast doubt on the official narrative. And yet, it was notable how many attendees \u2013 despite the obvious risks, and including those whose job titles might imply the need to proclaim undying loyalty for the government \u2013 offered whispered thanks outside the conference room for the simple words which those of us protected by foreign passports could speak on their behalf. Dialogue is valuable if it leads to change. But dialogue whose main purpose is to avoid the truth is an insult to the people of Uzbekistan. </p> <p>Those who risk their lives for a more just Uzbekistan want more pressure on the government, not less. They argue that consistency will pay dividends. \"They mustn't stop. Water wears down the stone,\" says one Uzbek human rights defender. Meanwhile, however, \"constructive engagement\" is fast becoming the new European buzzword. The policy is not just immoral, but dangerously shortsighted. If the repression continues, instability is likely to grow. When Uzbekistan shows real openness \u2013 with a genuinely free press, an end to show trials, and full accountability for the crimes of Andijan \u2013 that will be the time to offer the government rewards. Any other approach would be a shameful failure.</p>",
  "<p>If there's a theme emerging in this year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/bookerclub\">Booker club</a>, it seems to be that more is less. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/sep/23/sea.poppies\">The Sea of Poppies</a> is baggy with daft dialogue; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/aug/22/theindianeconomicmiraclemi\">The White Tiger</a> overloaded with aphorism; there's too much straining for profundity in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/sep/05/bookerclubthesecretscriptur\">The Secret Scripture</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/oct/03/booker.prize.philip.hensher\">The Northern Clemency</a> is burdened by too much detail. Steven Toltz's 700-plus-page debut, meanwhile, is another potentially excellent book undone by its excesses.</p> <p>This time the problem lies (with apologies for another oxymoron) in an over-abundance of wit. Toltz's sharp intelligence isn't in doubt, but his discipline is. No single idea can appear in his book without another three snapping at its heels, jostling for space and attention. Hardly a paragraph concludes without a joke. Metaphor is piled over metaphor, aphorism upon aphorism, cynical observation on cynical observation, and philosophical conundrum on top of conundrum.</p> <p>Sometimes the results are exhilarating, impressive, and/or hilarious. Loneliness is described as \"the slow squeeze of testicles by a hand that has just been in a refrigerator\". Eyes' pupils are like \"broken pieces of night\". The main narrator, Jasper Dean, tells us that he has \"ears pressed flat against my head like they were waiting for someone to pass\". The futility of trying to forget gets the following treatment: \"When you put in that much effort to forget someone, the effort itself becomes a memory. Then you have to forget the forgetting and that too is memorable.\" And read this for an uncomfortable truth about prisons: \"The state is always going about the business of introducing dangerous criminals to each other - they plunge them right into the network.\"</p> <p>At other times, the boom-tish joking and constant clever-cleverness annoy. A tense moment is interrupted with the observation: \"He scratched his tattoo. It wouldn't come off.\" A gun is retrieved from a sugar pot, seemingly only in order to set up the following tumbleweed-and-low-wind failure of a one-liner: \"The gun was still there but the sugar was gone. There was nothing sweet about it any more.\" An already irritating essay about Hamlet is made yet more groan-inducing by this nugget of wisdom: \"By the end of the play, everyone is dead, too bad for Shakespeare if he decided he later wanted to write a sequel.\"</p> <p>The plot, meanwhile, is readily acknowledged to be a \"scarcely credible sequence of disasters\". It veers from the sublime, to the sublimely ridiculous, to the plain annoying. Following the disastrous attempts of Martin Dean to put the world to rights and the struggle of his son Jasper to escape his influence, the beginning at least is inspired. This is the story of Martin's half brother Terry Dean, a psychopathic criminal who becomes a folk hero by killing anyone who cheats at sport, and thus neatly comments on two of Australia's biggest obsessions: team games and the Ned Kelly-style hero. From here it launches into the creation of a handbook of crime; pitched battles between Algerian gangsters; a crazy scheme to make everyone in Australia a millionaire \u2026 The gleeful absurdity remains but the suspicion of pointlessness creeps in - especially by the time the heroes are hiding out in a remote village in Thailand, one of them smearing himself in \"oil made of the fat melted from the chin of a woman who died in childbirth\". </p> <p>So, the book is a big jumble of mad ideas, crazed rants and surreal unlikelihoods. Not that that isn't the intention. As the title suggests, one of the central conceits concerns the many complex twists and turns within the character of a man and those that surround him. Toltz even provides a gloriously over-the-top metaphor to further make the point: Martin builds a house in the middle of a maze he creates in the outback, making him \"a labyrinth in a labyrinth\". </p> <p>Less easy to forgive is the fact that in spite of its frequent brilliance the book grows dull. Too many jokes fall flat, too few of the characters ring true, and, while Toltz has a neat line in maxims, there's no real feeling of profundity. By the time the book stuttered to a close with a list of nine (count them!) aphorisms, I was wishing Toltz had provided a smaller fraction of this over-sized whole.</p>",
  "<p>An insurance firm is offering parents cover against local authorities denying their children a place at their first-choice school.</p> <p>Home insurer Sheilas' Wheels will provide a lawyer to parents who have missed out on a place and want to appeal.</p> <p>Last year nearly 57,000 parents launched appeals after being told they lived too far from their favourite school to send their children there. </p> <p>But the move, thought to be the first of its kind by an insurance firm, has been criticised for trying to mislead parents.</p> <p>A spokeswoman from the insurer told the Guardian: \"In the current economic climate, I think parents will be looking more closely at how they can fight any appeals without spending a penny. This will give parents peace of mind.\"</p> <p>However, parents are entitled to free legal advice from their local authority and do not have to pay for an appeal.</p> <p>Les Lawrence, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said he was \"gobsmacked\" that the insurer was implying parents had to pay to appeal.</p> <p>\"This could actually dissuade parents from acting within their rights and appealing. They do not need to pay,\" he said. </p> <p>He said it was \"almost akin to ambulance-chasing law firms\", who solicit business from accident victims. \"This firm is just offering something to try to expand their business and increase their premium,\" he said.</p> <p>In a poll of 880 parents, commissioned by the insurer, one in seven said they would pretend a relative's address was their own to get their child into the \"right\" school.</p> <p>At least one in 12 said they would try to sweet-talk a headteacher to secure a place.</p> <p>The survey shows parents and local authorities are at loggerheads over school admissions. </p> <p>While 56% of parents are against the use of a lottery to award school places, more councils intend to adopt this system next year. </p> <p>At least two-thirds of councils in England will allocate places in oversubscribed schools by lottery next year, the Local Government Association has said.</p> <p>A code introduced last year to try to make school admissions fairer allows councils and schools to use lotteries.</p> <p>A third of the parents quizzed would consider moving home if it helped their child get into their favourite school.</p> <p>Some 5% would buy another home, 4% would change religion and 1% would attempt to bribe teachers to secure a place. Just under a quarter - 24% - would appeal if their child was denied a place.</p> <p>The findings come days after, Philip Hunter, the chief adjudicator for schools admissions, admitted some children would have been unfairly awarded places this year.</p> <p>Hunter told the Guardian half of all school authorities in England were breaching the new admissions code.</p> <p>He admitted there had been \"widespread\" failure by schools to remove discriminatory questions about parents' marital and employment status from application forms, and to make clearer the definitions in their admissions rules.</p> <p>Hunter will unveil a report on whether schools are complying with the new admissions code next month.</p> <p>The education secretary, Ed Balls, ordered the report after a study of three local authorities found schools breaking the laws - most controversially, by asking parents for financial contributions.</p>",

As well as already selling to NBC in the States, CTV in Canada and Network Ten in Australia, it's distributor FremantleMedia Enterprises has completed a raft of further deals with RTL, the biggest commercial broadcaster in Germany; Italy's Mediaset, the country's biggest broadcaster; SVT in Sweden and NED in the Netherlands.</p> <p>The BBC's hit crime drama <strong>Criminal Justice</strong> is also going great guns, having been sold to a range of international broadcasters including TVNZ in New Zealand, Sweden's SVT and Canada's Superchannel by it's distributor Portman Film and Television.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a> today said British taxpayers would benefit from the government's decision to pump up to \u00a337bn into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hbos\">HBOS</a> in an attempt to prevent UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banking</a> meltdown.</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/banking-economy\">weekend negotiations</a>, which continued through last night, the Treasury unveiled an unprecedented banking rescue plan earlier today.</p> <p>The scheme will see bank bosses facing a crackdown on pay and bonuses, and shareholder dividends will be frozen. </p> <p>The government will take a controlling stake in RBS in return for up to \u00a320bn from the taxpayer. </p> <p>Alistair Darling told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that total ownership in RBS, through a combination of ordinary and preference shares, would be 60%, with the figure for HBOS 40%.</p> <p>The chancellor refused to speculate on how long the state ownership of bank shares would continue, but insisted the move to stabilise banks was an investment that would benefit the taxpayer.</p> <p>\"There is every reason to be confident that, as we go through this, the British taxpayer will get his money back,\" he told the BBC. </p> <p>\"There is a distinction between what we have done here and the borrowing that governments incur on a day-to-day basis. </p> <p>\"These conditions just now are exceptional and extraordinary and it is right that the government supports the economy ... but I am very mindful of the fact that the government needs to keep lending under control.\"</p> <p>Asked when the state shares would be refloated, he said he did not think it \"would be wise to speculate on when this is going to happen\".</p> <p>\"We will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes,\" he added. \"Ultimately, we want to return the banks to private sector because I don't think the government can run them in the long run.\"</p> <p>Questioned on whether nationalisation meant all deposits would be protected, Darling said: \"Given the stakehold we have in this bank, that sends a pretty clear message.\"</p> <p>He said RBS and HBOS would continue to be run on a commercial basis and at arms' length from the government. </p> <p>The government had been forced to act because the banks had no other way to get the money they needed to stay afloat, he added.<br> \"Our intention is stabilisation and reconstruction,\" he said. \"That is the objective, and that is what I intend to see through.\"</p> <p>Darling said other countries should take similar measures to deal with what was a \"truly global problem\".</p> <p>\"We are living in extraordinarily turbulent times,\" he said. </p> <p>\"As long as governments the world over are prepared to take decisive action ... I think there are good reasons to believe that this will be seen as a very significant step along the way to getting through this.\" </p> <p>He admitted that lessons needed to be learned on both domestic regulation and the international stage.</p> <p>\"The regulation system needs to face up to the global consequences,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Young people aged 16 and 17 will be able to vote for the first time in forthcoming elections on the island of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/jerseyisland\">Jersey</a> this week.</p> <p>The island voted to lower the minimum voting age from 18 to 16 in July 2007 but the change in the law hasn't been exercised until now. The age group makes up 2% of a population of around 90,000 people, with over half of the island registered to vote in the elections on Wednesday.</p> <p>Derek Gray, the chair of the privileges and procedures committee, which was charged with reform in the States, the name by which the government of Jersey is known, said: \"Guernsey and the Isle of Man have already lowered the voting limit but we're not following the leader, we actually want to engage with our young people. Sixteen and 17-year-olds already have a lot of responsibilities like getting married, so it seems logical they should be able to vote. </p> <p>\"The ones we've talked to have felt they want to participate but I think there will be a core of youngsters who are interested and a large number who won't. We've had a good response though.\"</p> <p>A total of 21 candidates - a record number - are vying for six of 12 senator positions in the Jersey government to oversee island-wide affairs. The elections will also see four constables, who have responsibility for four parish districts, chosen.</p> <p>Like its Channel Island sister, Guernsey, Jersey maintains its own government system. It is classed as a British Crown Dependency, or \"peculiar of the Crown\", with a chief minister at its head. Compared with the British system of government, Jersey also has a number of other peculiarities, including a lack of political parties - all but two of the 21 candidates are independent.</p> <p>Jonathan Pyke, the national steering co-ordinator for the Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for people aged 16 and over to be able to vote in the UK, said Jersey's move showed increasing support for lowering the minimum voting age across the continent. </p> <p>\"In the long term young people are more likely to become engaged in politics. They tend to be more idealistic and passionate about issues and it would be great to see this injected into politics,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Children are learning about democracy and citizenship in schools so they should be able to participate and not have to wait two years. The Labour party and the Liberal Democrats in Britain have supported the idea, as have the Welsh assembly and the Scottish parliament. We're really beginning to see movement in this area - Jersey, Guernsey and Austria have all now adopted the minimum age of 16,\" Pyke said.</p> <p>Current hot topics on the island include underage drinking and whether clocks should be changed to Central European Time, about which there will be a referendum on Wednesday.</p> <p>All 21 candidates have been taking part in hustings, tackling topics from whether the public should be able to elect the chief minister to proposals for improving bus services.</p>",
  "<p>California State University in Northridge, a huge pubic university in Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley, has its own Spanish-language student newspaper and web site, <a href=\"http://www.csun.edu/elnuevosol/\">El Nuevo Sol</a>.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338520009\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1851735885_FINAL-Latin-Youth-Vote-AIC-FLV-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Its young editors represent the diversity within the city's Latino population: although much of the debate over immigration centers on Mexican Americans, many of these students belong to a growing Central American community. </p> <p>In the offices of El Nuevo Sol last week, the student editors debated the pros and cons of the presidential candidates - in the end coming out for Obama, though none too enthusiastically. </p> <p>While none of them favors McCain, they acknowledge that in recent decades, whatever little immigration reform has come was put forth not by Democrats, but by Republicans. </p> <p>While \"amnesty\" is now a dirty word among the anti-immigration forces, it was Ronald Reagan, in 1986, who signed into law <a href=\"http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/110686b.htm\">the immigration bill that placed millions of undocumented immigrants on the road to citizenship</a>. And while Hillary Clinton argued during the primaries that the Republican approach to immigration reform would \"criminalise Jesus,\" it was Bill Clinton, in 1996, who signed <a href=\"http://www.ilw.com/micasa/home.htm\">one of the most restrictive and punitive immigration bills in recent history</a>. The young journalists can only hope Obama will do better.</p> <p>Both of the current candidates once showed promise on the issue. John McCain, in an earlier, less right-wing mode, joined with Ted Kennedy in an <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/02/28/kennedy_mccain_try_again_on_immigration/\">unsuccessful attempt to wring a bipartisan immigration reform bill out of the Democratic-controlled Congress</a>, while Barack Obama at one point seemed poised to take on immigration as a civil rights issue, and supported the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/notion?pid=76067\">May Day immigrants' rights demonstrations</a> in 2006.</p> <p>But both candidates have since backed away from talking about their positions, apparently not wanting to rile the powerful feelings that surround the debate on both sides, and immigration has become the issue that dare not speak its name in the 2008 election. </p> <p>This state of affairs is ironic, considering the fact that year, as never before, <a href=\"http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&amp;id=7635&amp;cha=10\">Latinos of all backgrounds are a force in the presidential election</a>, and both candidates are actively courting their votes - and <a href=\"http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2008/06/obama-and-the-l.html\">Obama, it appears, winning most of them</a>. </p> <p>The Latino community itself has been highly mobilised, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95090073\">promises to turn out in record numbers</a>: Here in Los Angeles, the Coalition for Humane Immigration Reform of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) recently announced that it had <a href=\"http://www.chirla.org/node?page=\" 1\" tk\">registered 24,000 new voters</a>, most of them at naturalization ceremonies. And in a number of key swing states, the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/402/index.html\">Latino vote could tip the electoral college in either direction</a>. Yet young Latino voters like those here at Northridge are faced with choosing between two candidates who offer next to nothing on the questions that matter to them most.</p>"
